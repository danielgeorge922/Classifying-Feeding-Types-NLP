Mom states that the baby had a frenotomy done, but breastfeeding is still painful. Mom was instructed to suck train the baby and I used a 24 mm nipple shield and assisted mom with latching the baby onto the breast in a cross-cradle and the baby had a good latch with a nutritive suck. Mom states that the this has been her best latch. We discussed the importance of the asymmetric latch and not pulling back on the breast.   Plan and Education : Mom has already started pumping. Massage and hand expression was taught a large amount of colostrum was expressed and applied to the nipples and areola. Skin to skin was encouraged in between feedings. Mom is an employee here and she was made aware of the location of out pumping rooms and she was referred to the Center for Breastfeeding .  Mom was given lanolin and breast shells given with instruction. Mom encouraged to call the lactation office if she has any concerns.",3

"Lactation:  Consult per mother's request for nipple soreness with initial latch only.   Lactation history:  Mother reports she nursed her two sons for 14 months and 1 year respectively.    Feeding assessment:  I observed baby in mid-feed through the end of the feed in the cradle hold on the right, and baby had an optimal deep latch with wide gape well onto the areola.  When baby finished the feed, the right nipple was nonreddened and intact, although there is an arc along the underside of the nipple from 8 o'clock to 4 o'clock that appears to be a very slight inversion of that portion of the nipple.  The L nipple is also nonreddened and intact, and is also partially inverted but more so than the right, with a similar but deeper arc at the inverted aspect of the L nipple.  Breasts are medium in size, closely spaced, rounded and symmetrical.    Mother had previously been provided with a USP-grade lanolin product for nipple care, and mother was encouraged to apply the lanolin to any sore area of her nipples after each feed.  Mother was advised that one aspect of her nipple soreness may be the pull of the inverted aspects of her nipples while the baby suckles, and another aspect is the discomfort with the initial latch when the mother's nipple is pulled past the hard surfaces of baby's alveolar ridge and hard palate.  This latter aspect of nipple soreness should be fleeting within the first few seconds of the latch, due to the nipple then being pulled to the baby's soft palate with continued suckling.    An additional observable aspect of the mother's transient soreness during the feed occurred when the mother pressed her breast tissue away from baby's nose, citing the need to create more breathing space for baby's nose.  Mother was advised that pulling the breast tissue away from baby's nose was unnecessary due to baby's adequate breathing space, which was pointed out during the feed, and mother was advised that pulling the breast tissue away from baby has the undesired effect of pulling the nipple back toward the front of baby's mouth near the hard surfaces of the baby's alveolar ridge and hard palate, which can be damaging to the maternal nipple.    Mother stated that she does not plan to work outside the home anytime soon.  Mother was advised of the Affordable Care Act's mandate to private health insurance companies to provide insured mothers with a breastpump per birth.  Mother was provided with [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**]'s breastfeeding handbook with a brief review of the two-page feeding & diaper count chart.  Mother was provided with an invitation to [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**]' Breastfeeding Mothers' Support Group on Tuesdays. Mother was encouraged to call for assistance as desired, and to call with any questions or concerns.  [**NAME**], RN BSN IBCLC Lactation Consultant",1

Able to easily hand express large drops of colostrum, which infant licked off, but infant unable to open mouth and coordinate tongue to achieve effective latch to bare breast. I didn't want infant to burn too many calories or wait too long to take in calories, so size 20 nipple shield applied. Infant immediately latched, sucked and swallowed in coordiated effort for > 20 minutes. Mother denied pain. As infant would slow sucks, mother provided breast massage to further optimize breastfeed. Colostrum noted in shield.   Hand expressed other breast for mother and obtained 1 mL of colostrum in syringe for later use as needed. Discussed milk storage guidelines.  Since infant is IUGR and LPTI, instructions included.  1. STS as much as possible 2. Feed based on cue but do not go longer than 3-4 hours without offerring breast and/or EBM 3. If feed is not optimal, encouraged pumping 10-15 minutes after that feed.   Discussed tobacco withdrawal s/s, as mother is smoker.   Will f/u as needed.

"This note was copied from the chart of BABY/[**NAME**]. Lactation:  Follow-up consult for maternal nipple pain with feeds.  Although baby underwent frenotomy yesterday, baby has a high palate, which is a risk factor for nipple pain and nipple damage due to the nipple being moved higher with each suck, and mother's nipples are fairly short, which is another risk factor for nipple pain and nipple damage.  The shorter the maternal nipple, the greater the risk for the nipple to be in contact with the hard surfaces of the alveolar ridge and hard palate near the front of the baby's mouth, in contrast to the maternal comfort experienced when the nipple reaches the baby's soft palate, termed ""the comfort zone"" for the mother's comfort.  During yesterday evening's consult, mother's nipple was visibly creased/pinched in spite of baby's deep latch with wide gape well onto the areola.    This morning mother reports difficult feedings overnight with unsuccessful attempts by nursing staff when baby was crying near the breast, as compared to yesterday evening's lactation consultation when baby was brought to the breast in a calm state.  When babies are actively crying, the tongue is elevated with each cry, and the mother's nipple cannot then reach the superior aspect of the baby's tongue.  A helpful analogy is the impossible task of trying to drink out of a straw when placing the straw under the tongue, instead of correctly placing the straw above the tongue.  Today the mother reports she has decided to temporarily express her milk and give baby her bottled milk, due to painful feedings at the breast and baby's difficulty with the oral grasp at the breast.  Today baby's I & O sheet reflects adequate stooling and very high urine output, and the parents were given extensive teaching on monitoring baby's feedings and output by using the tracking sheet in [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**]'s breastfeeding handbook.    Mother was commended for her current volume of expressed milk, which is higher than average for baby's age (baby will reach 48 hours of age at 7:43pm today).  Mother was provided with a pumping log, and her two pumpings were recorded on this log in order for mother to assess her higher than average volume of expressed milk so soon after the birth.  Mother reports she expressed 8ml with the first of her daily pumpings today, and she expressed 15ml with second pumping this morning.  Today's goal for Day 3 postpartum is a daily total of 30 to 75ml from at least 8 pumpings, so mother's expressed milk thus far today at a total of 23ml from her two morning pumpings has impressively approached the low normal range of 30ml from at least 8 pumpings, and thus mother was highly commended for her milk production.    Evidence of Lactogenesis II in this mother is present re: the increase in volume over colostrum alone, and mother was advised to expect a full milk supply of 25 to 35 ounces daily by expressing her milk at least 8 times daily, including at least two nighttime pumpings, and this volume is typically achieved with such pumping frequency within 7 to 14 days after the birth.  Similarly, newborns need to feed at least 8 to 12 times every 24 hours in order to gain weight appropriately.   Parents report they will be taking baby for his first pediatrician's visit on Monday, [**DATE**].  We reviewed the contact information for infant nutrition resources listed in [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**]'s breastfeeding handbook, and mother was warmly invited, along with her baby, to [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**]' breastfeeding mothers support group on Tuesdays.  Mother was encouraged to call for assistance as needed/as desired, and to call with any questions or concerns.  [**NAME**], RN BSN IBCLC Lactation Consultant",3

Lactation assistance: The pt verbalized great satisfaction at my arrival and verbalized concerns about the baby's latch. I educated her on how to support the baby's shoulders while latching baby close to her breast so chin touches and head tilts back to facilitate an assymetric latch. Baby nursed on mothers left breast for several minutes without the use of a nipple shield. Breast massage and hand expression were taught and the pt demonstrated both techniques appropriately. The breastfeeding booklet and invitation to the breast feeding support group were provided. The pt called me back about an hour later as she was having difficulty latching baby on the right breast. The baby was calmed down with a gloved finger and then placed STS in a football hold. After several attempts the baby was not able to latch on effectively and appeared more and more upset. The pt used a 20 mm nipple shield and the baby latched for just a few moments but was still having difficulty. A 24 mm nipple shield was then used and baby latched much better and was suckling better at the breast without difficulty. I encouraged both the pt and the FOB to call back at any time breastfeeding support is needed or questions arise.,1

Incompetent cervix with advanced cervical dilation and prolapsing membranes  DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  1. Postpartum   MAJOR PROCEDURES PERFORMED: 1. Intravenous Ampicillin, Azithromycin, Gentamicin, and Metronidazole 2. Emergency MacDonald Rescue Cerclage 3. Misoprostol Induction of Labor at 20 weeks gestation 4. Vaginal delivery  SUMMARY: [**NAME**] is a 33 y.o.  female P 0-0-1-0, presenting with a 19 week intrauterine pregnancy with vaginal bleeding.  On admission she was found to be dilated to 3 centimeters with 30 percent effacement and bulging membranes.  Amniotic fluid index was 13.1 at the time.  For full history of present illness please see complete history and physical exam. She was admitted on hospital day one and was started on ampicillin and azithromycin intravenously for exposed membranes.  She was evaluated by Maternal Fetal Medicine and on hospital day three underwent an emergency MacDonald cerclage, and she was started on gentamicin and metronidazole.  For details please see the dictated operative note.  She tolerated the procedure well without incident.  She was transferred to the floor, where she remained stable until hospital day seven when she reported leaking of fluid.  Speculum exam was equivocal with a positive nitrazine but negative fern test, however ultrasound revealed new anhydramnios.  The patient was counseled regarding her options, and she decided to terminate the pregnancy.  Consents were signed and witnessed.  Her cerclage was removed and a misoprostol induction of labor was begun.  On hospital day eight she delivered a live 20 week fetus which subsequently died.  Her placenta delivered spontaneously and complete delivery was confirmed on ultrasound.  She declined autopsy or cremation.  She was ambulating, voiding spontaneously and tolerating a regular diet.  She was then discharged home in good condition.    DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: You may immediately resume your usual diet. You may take a shower or a bath, according to your preference.

Please remember that you may have become deconditioned because of relative inactivity in late pregnancy, and you may require some time to re-establish your prior level of fitness.  You should take a multivitamin that contains folic acid (400micrograms) and elemental iron (60mg) each day. If your doctor prescribed oral contraceptives for birth control, please start the medication as directed.

She was started on magnesium for tocolysis, PPROM, and betamethasone course. Secondary to nonreassuring fetal heart tracing, IOL was started with pitocin once patient was status post betamethasone injections. Patient again started having repetitive variable decelerations despite amnioinfusion and vaginal bleeding, concerning for abruption. The decision was made to proceed with induction and trial of vaginal delivery as the fetal heart rate tracing was overall reassuring. Shortly after patient had her first episode of bleeding (see notes for more details), she was found to be completely dilated and went on to deliver a liveborn infant male, weighing 2078 g with Apgars of 9 and 9. Following delivery, patient had a postpartum hemorrhage requiring manual extraction of clots from LUS, a total of 40 units of pitocin, and misoprostol 1000 mg per rectum. Hct went from 38.2 --> 32.9, platelets were stable, and coags wnl. Her bleeding eventually stopped and her fundus remained firm. On PPD#2, she was discharged home as she was with minimal vaginal bleeding, with good pain control, tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, and voiding spontaneously.

"Lactation note The pt was nipple nursing her baby in a cross cradle position with the baby swaddled in a blanket. The room was cold and the baby felt cool to the touch. I advised her on the risk of nipple trauma and pain resulting from the baby's poor latch and the risk of poor milk transfer and low milk supply. I was able to assist her with repositioning the baby in a football hold and the baby did obtain a deep asymmetric latch. The pt continued to pull back on her breast to try to view the baby. I discussed how pulling back causes the baby to loose her hold and can result in nipple trauma as well. The pt told me that she had 2 minutes left to breast feed her baby so I asked if she was timing her. She states that she was told to only breast feed for 15 minutes on each breast I re educated her about feeding cues, cluster feeding and unrestricted feeding sessions. I encouraged her to continue breast feeding as long as the baby wants to continue. I also encouraged her to offer the second breast to allow the baby more if she wants more. Continue to offer assistance and support as needed. [**NAME**] BSN, CLC",1

"Pt called out for assistance with infant feeding and latch.  Infant became very fussy/agitated when offered bare breast in right clutch position.  Parents excellent at calming infant, very patient. Infant calms readily with offered gloved finger, able to suck, able to latch right after and nurse briefly with audible swallowing. Attempt to re-latch resulted in more agitation, suggested and pt was able to hand express several mls of colostrum and offer to infant via spoon, calmed and then attempt to re-latch.   Infant noted to elevate tongue to roof of mouth most of the time, only briefly dropping tongue while attempting latch, making latching very difficult.  Continued to attempt for approximately 10 minutes, then pt applied nipple shield and latched infant well. Audible swallowing and milk in shield confirmed transfer.   Suggested pumping after feeds involving nipple shield and offering EBM via cup/spoon prior to feeds to assist with calming infant. Also encouraged to keep STS and offer breast at earliest signs of hunger, rather than delaying feed with diaper change, etc. Encouraged to offer  Bare breast first and use shield only if needed.

"Lactation assistance: The pt welcomed me warmly upon my introduction and offering for assistance. She verbalized immediately some concerns with baby's latch and nipple trauma to her right breast. She stated that baby had nursed for 45 minutes earlier and she felt the pain but did not know what to do so she kept nursing. She denies any pain on the left breast but said she was unable to latch baby on that side anyway. She has pendulous supple breasts with slightly everted nipples that respond to well to tactile stimulation. I first instructed her on STS with its many benefits and breast massage and hand expression during which I undressed baby and placed her STS. Colostrum was readily expressed and baby was placed in a football hold and was easily asymmetrically latched to the breast. I explained the details of a deep latch with the chin tucked into the breast, good support to the neck and shoulders and a clear airway to the nose. The patient practiced breast massage, hand expression and a supportive hand hold in a safe manner for her and baby. I provided her with written materials for her education reinforcement. The baby was noted to chomp and some nipple compression was noted on the left nipple when baby was detached. I informed the Peds service and requested an assessment with the baby exam.

Liveborn infant male weighing 3420 grams with Apgars of 1 and 5.  SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY: Placenta  INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 25 y.o. female para 0010 who presented for induction of labor for poorly controlled type 1 diabetes on an insulin pump. During induction of labor the patient developed an arrest of dilation at 4 cm. The decision was made to proceed with cesarean delivery.   DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfanenstiel incision. The subcutaneous tissue was incised with electrocautery. The fascia was scored with electrocautery. The fascia was dissected from the anterior rectus muscle using electrocautery, curved mayo scissors, and blunt dissection. The rectus muscle was divided at the midline. The peritoneum was entered using Metzenbaum scissor. The peritoneal incision was extended bilaterally with traction.  A bladder flap was not created.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with traction.  The amniotic fluid was clear.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician.

After cesarean delivery, left fallopian tube, IP ligament and broad ligament were found to have hematomas. Liveborn infant male weighing 2625 grams with Apgars of 5 and 9.  SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY:  INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 29 y.o. female para 4125 who was admitted to labor and delivery at 35 weeks for chest pain and then extended monitoring after falling and hitting her abdomen. The pt's tocometry showed uterine irritability and the pt complained of abdominal pain, but this subsided and FHT was reactive over the course of the evening.  At 0615, the pt returned from using the restroom and nursing was unable to obtain a fetal heart tone. A heart beat could not be seen on ultrasound but fetal movement was noted. The pt was moved to the OR and a normal heart rate was found on repeat ultrasound. It was felt the fetus likely had an episode of bradycardia. Given bradycardia in the setting of recent fall, abdominal pain, and uterine irritability, we proceeded with cesarean delivery.  DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a pfannensteil incision.  A bladder flap was created bluntly.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with the surgeon's fingers.  The amniotic fluid was clear.  The above described infant was delivered from the Breech presentation.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood was obtained for analysis.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.  The uterus was exteriorized, and the uterine incision was closed in 2 layers, the first a running locking suture of 0 Vicryl and the second a running, imbricating suture of 0 Vicryl.  Excellent hemostasis was noted.   Next attention was turned to the tubal ligation. The right fallopian tube was identified by the fimbria, double ligated with #1-plain gut suture and the intervening segment excised.  The left fallopian tube was identified by the fimbria, double ligated with #1 plain gut suture and the intervening segment excised.    It was noted after removing the segment of the left tube, that there was a small defect in the uterine serosa between the round ligament and fallopian tube. This was oversewn with a 3-0 vicryl.    The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity.  Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision. However on re-examination of the left fallopian tube and left infundipular pelvic ligament, the distal portion of the fallopian tube was noted to be forming a large hematoma as was the IP. The uterus was exteriorized. The distal portion of the fallopian tube was removed by progressively clamping, cutting, and tying along the fallopian tube/mesosalping junction. After removal of the tube. The left side of the uterus was again inspected and noted to have an expanding hematoma of the broad ligament and infundibulopelvic ligament. It was felt that given expanding hematoma a hysterectomy was indicated to stop the expansion. At this point the pt was awake. We discussed the situation with the pt. She said she was planning on a hysterectomy later on for abnormal bleeding anyway. The pt was placed under general anesthesia after verbally consenting to hysterectomy.  The right round ligament was transfixion sutured with 0 Vicryl and divided with cautery (for the remainder of the dictation, all suture will be 0 Vicryl unless otherwise stated).  The anterior leaf broad of the broad ligament and the vesicouterine peritoneum on the patient's left side were incised with a combination of cautery and sharp dissection to a point below the uterine incision and broad ligament hematoma, but above the cervix.  The posterior leaf of the broad ligament was incised with cautery and sharp dissection. A defect was made in the posterior leaf of the broad ligament beneath the uteroovarian ligament and the proximal fallopian tube.  The uteroovarian ligament and the proximal fallopian tube were doubly clamped, incised, and doubly ligated; the second suture was a transfixion suture.The right uterine vessels were skeletonized. The right uterine vessels were doubly clamped, divided, and sutured.  The same process was repeated on the right side.    The left round ligament was transfixion sutured with 0 Vicryl and divided with cautery (for the remainder of the dictation, all suture will be 0 Vicryl unless otherwise stated).  The anterior leaf broad of the broad ligament and the vesicouterine peritoneum on the patient's left side were incised with a combination of cautery and sharp dissection to a point below the uterine incision and broad ligament hematoma, but above the cervix.  The posterior leaf of the broad ligament was incised with cautery and sharp dissection. The right uterine vessels were skeletonized. The left uterine vessels were doubly clamped, divided, and sutured.  The same process was repeated on the right side. A defect was made in the posterior leaf of the broad ligament beneath the uteroovarian ligament and the proximal fallopian tube.  The uteroovarian ligament and the proximal fallopian tube were doubly clamped, incised, and doubly ligated; the second suture was a transfixion suture.    The remainder of the bladder was separated from the underlying cervix with blunt dissection. The paracervical tissue was progressively clamped, incised, and ligated to a level below the uterine incision and broad ligament hematoma, but above the cervix.  Heaney clamps were placed across the uterus and the uterus was amputated using a scalpel. The specimen was handed off the surgical field.  Interrupted imbricating stitches of 0-vicryl were used to close the the uterine amputation site. The angles were closed with figure of eight stitches of 0-vicryl. Areas of bleeding were oversewn with figure of eight stitches of 0-vicryl. The pelvis was irrigated. The right ovary, tube and IP were examined and were noted to be intact without evidence of injury of hematoma. The right ureter was identified and was noted to be far away from the cervical stump and any suture material. Hemostasis along the right pelvic side wall was achieved with cautery and Arista. The left IP and ovary were examined. The IP hematoma had decreased slightly in size, however given concern for possible retroperitoneal extension, the decision was made to proceed with left oophorectomy. A defect was made in the posterior leaf of the broad ligament beneath the infundibulopelvic ligament and above the ureter.  The IP ligament was doubly clamped, incised, and doubly ligated; the second suture was a transfixion suture.  The ureter was identified before clamping and cutting the IP ligament. The ureter was also identified at the level of the cervical stump and was noted to be far away from the angles. Inspection of the entire field revealed hemostasis. There was a hematoma in the left retroperitoneum that was stable and becoming smaller. All pedicles were hemostatic as was the cervical stump at the completion. Throughout case there was communication with anesthesia regarding blood loss and patient recieved prbcs and FFP was ordered.    The fascia was closed with one suture of 0-vicryl starting at the angle and running continuously.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and hemostasis was assured.  The subcutaneous tissue was reapproximated with a running stitch of 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with 4-0 polysorb. Benzoin, Steri-Strips, and a sterile dressing were applied to the incision.   . An x-ray was performed that showed no retained instruments of laps. The patient was, awakened from anesthesia, and transferred to the SICU in a stable condition.  All counts were correct at the end of the procedure.  [**NAME**], MD",1

Liveborn infant male weighing 2972 grams with Apgars of 8 and 9.  SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY: None  INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 26yo P0020 who was admitted at 39 weeks gestation with severely elevated blood pressures indicative of pre-eclampsia with severe features. On arrival, she had a category 2 fetal heart tracing. She was admitted and started on magnesium therapy and prior to starting pitocin induction of labor, she began contracting every 4-5 minutes. She then began having deep variable decelerations that could not be resolved with intrauterine resuscitation and was therefore taken to the operating room for Stat cesarean delivery.  DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table. A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed. After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.  The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfanenstiel incision. The fascia was scored in the midline and extended with sharp dissection laterally. The underlying rectus muscle was dissected off the fascia with blunt dissection. The rectus muscles were separated in the midline with blunt dissection and the peritoneum was entered bluntly. A bladder flap was not created. A low transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with traction.

"Lactation note I returned to assist with positioning and latch when the FOB called me. The baby was already STS and lying in a cross cradle position facing the right breast. Baby had a big open mouth with the nipple to nose stimulation technique and latched on readily. After a few sucks it was evident that the baby was sucking only on the nipple and not the breast. The mother are normal size breasts that are spaced far apart. Her right nipple is everted with a shorter base than the left side.The chin was held well into the breast but the baby was unable to manuver his neck to suck and swallow effectively. The baby was then repositioned in a football hold on the right breast and again stimulated to open his mouth. The baby was observed to have a deep and asymmetric latch that the mother reported felt better and after several minutes stated that she did not feel any pain. I demonstrated breast compressions and the baby suckled several times with intermittent  swallows. The baby remained calm and relaxed on the mothers breast. I commended her and encouraged her to practice positioning baby in ways that feel good to her and allows the baby to nurse deeply on her breast. She was also encouraged to call as needed. The FOB was present and very supportive. [**NAME**] BSN, CLC",1

"This note was copied from the chart of BOY/[**NAME**]. Lactation:  Consult per RN and mother's request for newborn with anterior vs. complete cleft lip on the L (unilateral) [please see pediatric assessment on [**DATE**]].  Mother is [**NAME**], a 25 y/o G1P1001 with negative and confirmed serologies, who was GBS+ and treated with ampicillin x 4.  Mother gave birth to her son on [**DATE**] at 12:35pm via spontaneous vaginal delivery.  GA by dates: 39w2d.  GA by exam: pending weeks, AGA by weight.  Birth weight: 3039g.  APGARS [**DATE**].     The mother's room was filled with happy extended family members who soon departed for the consult.  FOB was present for the consultation.   Mother reported that she experienced some biting during baby's earlier feed.   Mother plans to be a stay-at-home mother for an indefinite period of time.   Maternal breast assessment:  Breasts are medium to medium-large in size, closely spaced, and symmetrical with moderate density.  Nipple anatomy is well-defined and well-protracted, nonreddened and intact.    Infant assessment for feeding readiness:  Baby was awake and alert, licking lips and opening mouth.    Feeding assessment:  Mother was assisted in positioning her baby on the left breast in cross-cradle and cradle holds.  Baby displayed some brief initial on-and-off behavior on this first breast for less than one minute, and a 24mm nipple shield was provided to support the baby's ability to latch, although baby did not latch with the nipple shield.  Baby was returned to the breast without a nipple shield, then was soon able to sustain the latch with appropriately rhythmic suckling x 10 minutes.  The L breast was palpably softer after the feed.   Following a short 2-minute nap by the baby, the mother was assisted in positioning her baby in the cross-cradle hold and cradle hold on the right breast.  Baby latched quickly onto the second breast (the right), and the baby nursed for another 6 minutes into a deeply relaxed state re: complete hand and arm extension with limpness.  The mother's left breast was palpably softer than the right (the baby had nursed longer on the first breast, which was the left breast).  Baby displayed appropriate jaw excursions during the feed at both breasts, and there was frequent audible swallowing heard while baby nursed from each breast.    Patient teaching:  Mother was advised to offer the breast to her baby at least 8 to 12 times every 24 hours, in response to baby's early hunger cues of licking lips, hand-to-mouth, and rooting behavior.  The [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] breastfeeding handbook was provided, and we reviewed baby's reported one urine and one stool thus far as having met Day 1's goals for output per the handbook's feeding-and-diaper-change chart.  Mother was commended for baby's beautiful feeding, and the baby's father expressed his happiness in regard to how well his son had nursed.  Mother was encouraged to call for assistance as desired, and to call with any questions or concerns.  [**NAME**], RN BSN IBCLC Lactation Consultant",1

"Assessment: Pt called for latch observation - pt had already nursed infant for 5 minutes with audible swallowing on right breast before lactation entered room.  Breasts are full/firm, well developed.  Nipples are everted, pink but intact.  Pt is aware of how to hand express her breasts, and streams of colostrum noted bilaterally.   Intervention: Assisted pt to unwrap infant and attempt to latch infant in clutch hold on right breast - infant not interested at this time.  Burped infant, has hiccups, no feeding cues at this time. Reassured pt with her large colostrum supply, it was possible infant is done feeding after 5 minutes of active sucking/swallowing.  Discussed importance of asymmetrical, chin-led latch, as well as allowing infant to determine feeding times by observing infant for feeding cues.  Instructed to allow infant to finish on one breast, using breast compressions to maximize feeding time before switching to second breast at each feeding.  Reviewed nipple care, typical cluster feeding behavior, infant stomach capacity and expected output for infant.  Also discussed managing possible milk oversupply during milk onset. Discouraged use of pacifiers or artificial nipples until breastfeeding is well-established, around 3-4 weeks of age. Encouraged maximizing skin to skin time with infant over the next several days as well.

I spoke with the primary team this am including Dr. [**NAME**] I had reviewed the MRI studies as well as neurosurgery notes and attempted to see the patient in the afternoon but she was being cleaned up at that time. Later in the afternoon I was called and the primary team had decided to take her for c section. The MRI findings were interesting but difficult to explain. It appeared that she had adherence of a large section of the ventral cord beginning at around T4 (localizes well to her exam). Contrast was not given given the pregnancy. Neurosurgery had recommended EMG. While it was thought that this could possibly be helpful it will not be something that will happen over the weekend.  The patient will be signed out to Dr. [**NAME**] who will be rounding tomorrow.,0

"This note was copied from the chart of GIRL/Savanna Dye. Lactation:  Discharge rounding with 22-year-old mother and her newborn daughter born at 40 weeks 2 days gestation by SVD, weighing 2.235g.  Mother was adequately treated for CZ infection during pregnancy.  Baby had in utero tobacco exposure. Baby is not in mother's room due to a car seat challenge related to the baby's small size.  Mother reports baby is nursing well, and denies any nipple soreness during the feeds.   Mother does plan to work outside the home at some point, although she did not work outside the home with her first child who is now 15 months old.  Parents and their 15-month-old have been residing with the maternal grandparents here in [**LOCATION_CITY**].   Lactation history:  The older sibling was breastfed x 3 months.  Mother cites the difficulty at three months as a time when friends would frequently come by to visit without knocking, and she was uncomfortable nursing around others.  Mother also reports that she stopped breastfeeding suddenly at 3 months, and her breasts soon became ""sunken in"" for a time.  Maternal breast assessment:  Medium to large breasts are closely spaced and rounded, and the nipples are nonreddened and intact.   Discussion with recommendations:  We discussed the mother's first lactation experience and her sudden termination of breastfeeding, followed by a ""sunken-in"" appearance of her breasts for a period of time.  Mother was advised that this is referred to as breast involution, and frequently occurs when there is a sudden weaning versus a gradual weaning, though the mother's breasts typically return to their former tone within two to 3 menstrual cycles.   We discussed the expected onset of the mother's second milk, Lactogenesis II [L2], with the recommendation for frequent feeds to quickly address any breast engorgement.  Mother describes her previous lactation experience with breast engorgement as particularly dramatic, but improving within one to 2 days.  Mother was advised that this is the typical experience of most mothers, although a small number of mothers do experience a longer period of breast engorgement prior to its resolution.  Mother was reassured that the swelling with breast engorgement is many extra red blood cells and additional lymph fluid that supports the second milk coming in, but these extra fluids in the breasts are only needed to establish the second milk.  Continuation of the milk supply is based upon frequency of emptying the breasts, which stimulates frequent refill.    Mother is enrolled with WIC, and breastfeeding support was discussed through the WIC program.  Mother was provided with a pump kit as well as demonstration of the Medela Harmony manual pump, the type of pump the mother had used with her first child.  Mother was invited to our new mothers' breastfeeding support group, along with her children.",3

"This note was copied from the chart of BOY/[**NAME**]. Lactation:  Consult by RN request for this preterm infant's first breastfeeding practice session today.  Mother has been using a medical-grade electric breastpump in her patient room, and reports that she obtained drops in the bottom of the pump bottle from her most recent pumping today.     Maternal breast assessment:  Breasts are medium in size, closely spaced, pendulous and soft. There is a high level of elasticity in the areolae.  Nipple anatomy is well-defined and protractile.    Infant assessment for feeding readiness:  Infant was asleep beside the mother's breast upon my arrival, although RN reported baby had been displaying hand-to-mouth behavior several minutes prior.  Within five minutes of my arrival, baby stirred and displayed hunger cues re: rooting behavior and hand-to-mouth behavior.    Feeding assessment:  Mother was assisted in positioning her baby in the cross-cradle hold at the right breast.  Baby slept at the breast for five minutes, then roused, and mother was assisted in guiding baby in to the breast for the oral grasp/latch.  Baby was on-and-off the breast in a common early learning display, prior to learning how to achieve the oral grasp at the breast.  In less than 5 minutes, baby was able to sustain the latch and displayed appropriate rhythmic suckling with appropriate sucking bursts.  Baby nursed for approximately 30 minutes on the right breast, with occasional loss of latch every 5 to 10 minutes, then was assisted in successful re-latching.  After 30 minutes on the right breast, baby was assisted with positioning and latch in the football/clutch hold at the L breast.  Baby latched quickly on the second breast and nursed in an appropriate rhythmic manner, losing the latch only twice, and relatching without assistance on the second loss of the latch.  Baby nursed for another 15 minutes, then entered a state of deep relaxation and sleep, with the outer arm and fingers extended and limp.    Patient teaching:  Mother was advised to continue to express her milk after nursing, for at least 8 pumpings every 24 hours toward a full daily volume of 800ml that will likely be achieved by Day 14 or very soon thereafter.  In spite of this baby's early breastfeeding skill that was displayed today, preterm infants have less buccal fat pad tissue than term infants, and may not transfer adequate volumes from the breast until another pound of weight is gained, for example. (The newborn's buccal fat pads must contain adequate amounts of fat in order to babies to create enough vacuum pressure [""suction""] for adequate milk transfer.  Building and maintaining a full volume of 800ml of expressed milk daily is a standard recommendation to mothers of NICU babies, until the infant can exclusively breastfeed and gain weight well.  This pumping regimen is considered protective of the mother's milk supply, until the preterm infant displays the consistent ability to transfer adequate volumes of milk.  In this manner, the preterm infant is also protected by an abundant maternal milk supply.    Parents are to obtain a fax number for sending a prescription to their insurance company for a medical-grade electric breastpump.  The medical prescription has already been provided today to the parents via RN and nurse practitioner. Parents have also been given the contact information for local resources regarding a pump rental.  Even though the mother has already been provided with a high-end retail breastpump (Medela Pump In Style) by her insurance company, a medical-grade/hospital-grade electric breastpump is the standard of care for building full volume when there is daily separation between mother and baby, as in hospitalization.     At 1:45pm today, mother was able to express 3ml from the medical-grade electric breastpump in her patient room, and this was celebrated.  I had advised the mother earlier today to practice increasing the vaccum pressure [""suction""] as high as she could comfortably tolerate with the pump, and both parents were delighted with this marked increase in volume.

"This note was copied from the chart of GIRL/[**NAME**]. Lactation:  Rounds with MOB for bilateral nipple damage by RN Thetoria's report.  Discussed with the mother that her shorter nipple anatomy is vulnerable to nipple damage, though not a guarantee of nipple damage, due to the shorter nipple coming into greater contact with the baby's alveolar ridge and hard palate, as these hard surfaces are often  damaging to the maternal nipple.  Mother has been provided a USP-lanolin product by her RN, and we discussed the recommendation to pump for 2 to 5 minutes prior to helping baby with latch, so that the nipple has further depth into the tip of the nipple shield for the feeding, with less likelihood of the nipple staying in contact with the alveolar ridge and/or hard palate throughout feedings.   Mother was assisted in positioning her baby in the football hold on the L.  The nipple shield was partially inverted prior to application in order to protract the nipple, and this was effective in protracting the nipple, albeit not with maximum protractility.   Mother was advised to pump for 2 to 5 minutes prior to nursing baby with or without the shield.    For the nursing staff:  Please assess the mother's nipples for any further nipple damage and the healing process, and please assist the dyad with positioning and the baby's oral grasp as needed for effective milk transfer.

After placement of spinal anesthesia, fetal bradycardia to the 60s was noted. Decision was made to proceed with emergent cesarean delivery.   DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt. Fetal bradycardia was noted. An emergent cesarean section was called. Her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through prior Pfanenstiel incision.  The incision was taken down to the level of the fascia which was incised in the midline with scalpel. The incision was extended laterally in either direction over the rectus muscles.  The rectus muscle was divided sharply with a scalpel. The peritoneum was entered bluntly.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with the surgeon's fingers.  The amniotic fluid was clear upon rupture.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood was obtained for analysis.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.  The uterus was exteriorized, and the uterine incision was closed in  a running suture of 0 Vicryl. Additional sutures of 0 Vicryl were placed along hysterotomy for additional hemostasis.   The right fallopian tube was identified to its fimbriated end and a defect was made in a relatively avascular portion of the mesosalpinx underlying the mid isthmic portion of the tube.  A segment of the mid isthmic portion of the tube was ligated with two sutures of 0 Chromic suture and the intervening portion of the tube excised and handed off the field; adequate hemostasis was assured.  The exact same procedure was performed on the opposite side after identifying that tube to its fimbriated end; again, adequate hemostasis was assured.  The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity.  Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision, posterior to the bladder, and in the subfascial area.  The fascia was closed with one suture of 0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and closed with running suture of 3-0 vicryl.  The skin was closed with a running subcuticular closure of 3-0 Monocryl.  Dermabond was applied to the incision.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.  Dictated for Dr. [**NAME**], MD",0

"This note was copied from the chart of GIRL/[**NAME**]. Lactation:  F/u consult at the telephoned request of the FOB.  Mother and baby were assisted this morning by lactation nurse [**NAME**] who noted ""very sore reddened nipples,"" and baby subsequently underwent a frenotomy by Dr. [**NAME**].    [**NAME**] is a 22 y/o primipara who gave birth to her infant female via SVD on [**CONTACT_PHONE**] at 5:52pm.  GA by dates: 40w 1d.  GA by exam: 40 weeks AGA.  Birth weight:  3380g (7lb 7.2oz).  APGARS [**DATE**].  Pitocin was used as a pre/perinatal medication.  Baby was resuscitated by suctioning, oxygen, and PPV.    Maternal history:  Depression managed with Zoloft and Buspar.    Maternal breast assessment:  Breasts are medium in size, closely spaced, and somewhat pendulous.  The right breast is softer than the L, and mother reports baby just finished nursing on the rt.  The L breast was heavy prior to the feed, becoming softer as the feeding progressed, and we discussed the mother's early onset of her second milk coming in re: Lactogenesis II [L2] at less than 24 hours postpartum.  The nipple anatomy is quite short on the right, and the left nipple is flat though protractile to a short length via gentle tactile nipple stimulation.  There are pronounced abrasions to both nipples, more significant on the L.  Infant assessment for feeding readiness:  Babe was nursing at the right breast upon my arrival, and displayed hand-to-mouth behavior and licking of lips prior to subsequently nursing on the L breast.    Feeding assessment: Due to the extent of the mother's nipple damage as well as the flat nipple on the L, a 24mm nipple shield was used during the entire feed in cross cradle hold and cradle hold on the L.  Mother rated her pain level as ""7"" on a 0 to 10 pain scale after the initial latch at the one-minute mark, and after the baby had been nursing well over ten minutes.    Patient teaching:  Mother was advised that short and/or flat nipple anatomy is a risk factor for nipple damage, though not all mothers with short and/or flat nipple anatomy experience nipple soreness and/or nipple trauma.  However, the mother was advised that the shorter nipple can come into greater contact with the baby's gumline (upper alveolar ridge) and/or hard palate for all or part of a feeding, and that a deep latch is important for protecting the mother's nipple integrity, even with a nipple shield.      A USP-modified lanolin product with teaching was provided by mother's RN at my request, and I also asked the RN to provide the mother with breast shells for keeping her nipples protected from friction while the nipple wounds heal.  The breast shells also provide ample space so that all of the lanolin product can stay on the nipples, rather than much of the product being absorbed by bra fabric.  Mother was advised that if her nipple wounds become more painful that what she can tolerate, she may express her milk for any missed feedings in order to support her milk production while her nipple wounds continue to heal.  Mother was encouraged to call for assistance as desired, and to call with any questions or concerns.      [**NAME**], RN BSN IBCLC Lactation Consultant",1

When asked, MOB reports she is aware of how to pump and how to put the pump together.  Nursing has noted concerns related to MOB's ability to feed newborn without prompts, as well as providing misinformation about how much she had fed the baby.  MOB indicted to social work how often and how much to feed newborn and reported her last feeding and when the next feeding is expected.  MOB reports she has fed newborn, but reports FOB ""feeds him best.""  MOB reports she has changed newborn diapers, but reports FOB and family have initiated more ""so I can rest.""  MOB was encouraged to actively participate in newborn care so she can practice, learn, and ask questions while support staff is present.  Throughout this assessment, MOB appeared relaxed, open, honest and forthcoming.  At the end of this assessment, MOB was observed with the baby after he returned from a procedure.  He initially appeared inconsolable and social work offered some ideas for MOB that might make him comfortable, which MOB immediately attempted; baby responded well.  MOB reported feeling ""nervous"" and appeared insecure while soothing the baby.  Social work offered encouragement, because although MOB did not appear confident, she appeared soothing and loving with newborn.    The following day, and just prior to discharge, social work met again with MOB while FOB and her mother were at bedside. They actively participated in this assessment with MOB's permission.  FOB was holding newborn throughout this meeting.

"Lactation support and assistance: The pt was talking on the phone and busily working on cleaning her bedside table and bed linens when I arrived. The baby was crying loudly in the crib. I inquired about holding the baby which she verbally OK'd as she continued talking on the phone. The pt requested that I give the baby the remainder of the formula in the bottle, about 5 ml's. I found the baby to be extremely jittery and difficult to console. I place a gloved finger in her mouth and found that she had difficulty latching and sucking on my finger as well as on the nipple of the bottle. I changed her wet diaper and swaddled her and she became calm and returned to sleep. The pt requested that I return later. When I returned about 30 minutes later the pt was ending her phone call and returned to her bed for my assistance. The baby was placed STS on the mothers left breast. Massage and hand expression were performed with colostrum was expressed from both breasts in large droplets. I encouraged her to pump after breast feeding and to supplement with her breast milk. I educated her about the benefits of  breast massage and hand expression. I encouraged frequent STS . Feeding cues and feeding on demand at least 8-10 times/24hours reinforced. Encouraged mother to pump after each breastfeeding.  Breastfeeding book provided and reviewed. I reviewed the details of a nutritive latch, baby's daily feeding log, and outpatient resources.

Mom was able to express about 4 mls of colostrum to store for baby . Baby is currently NPO awaiting surgery for duodenal atresia repair. Mom was happy that she could see the colostrum.

I administered 2cc of lidocaine 2% with epinephrine 5mcg/mL, with relatively fast onset of numbness and motor block. Dr. [**NAME**] (AOD) notified of intrathecal catheter. CSF was aspirated from the catheter, confirming it was indeed intrathecal. VS remained stable, and no bolus dose was given. Pt is comfortable, catheter has been labeled with pink ""continuous spinal"" labels, nursing staff has been notified, and spinal infusion is being held until block from intrathecal lidocaine begins to resolve.  Plan: - Monitor patient closely. Since only lidocaine was given, expect block to start to wear within an hour.  - Nursing staff aware of catheter being intrathecal and infusion not running until block is less dense. - Will administer cosyntropin 1mg after delivery to decrease risk of PDPHA. - Patient was explained about continuous spinal, she voiced understanding of the situation and agrees with therapy. - Catheter to be pulled by anesthesia provider after delivery. - Call anesthesia if there is need for further analgesia.",1

Liveborn infant female weighing 3026 grams with Apgars of 5, 7 and 9.  Indication: [**NAME**] is a 30 y.o. female para 0121 who presented to L&D at 39w3d gestation for scheduled repeat cesarean delivery with bilateral tubal ligation.  She was consented for the above noted procedures then brought back to the operating room.  Procedure: After satisfactory anesthesia, perioperative antibiotics, the patient was prepped and draped in a routine fashion for abdominal surgery.  Time-out confirmed patient and procedure.  The abdomen was entered with a Pfannenstiel approach and dissected down to the level of the fascia with sharp dissection and cautery. The fascia was scored in the midline and extended laterally with sharp dissection. The anterior leaf of the fascia was grasped upwards and the underlying rectus muscle was dissected with sharp and blunt dissection. This was also performed inferiorly. The rectus muscles were separated in the midline and the peritoneum was entered and the underlying uterus exposed.  An Alexis O-ring Retractor was placed to aid visualization. A bladder flap was not created.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and extended laterally with blunt dissection.  Amniotic fluid was clear at the time of ROM.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation with assistance of a Kiwi vaccum.  The cord was clamped and cut and the baby handed to the pediatrician.  Blood for gases and DNA was obtained. An attempt was made to collect cord blood, but the placenta was already separating and only a small sample was obtained. The placenta was delivered with cord traction.  The uterus was then wiped out with a lap.  Ring forceps were placed on the angles of the hysterotomy as well as the upper and lower sections of the uterus.  The uterus was closed in a single layer closure using 0-Monocryl. The uterine incision was hemostatic and uterine tone adequate. Attention was then turned to the tubal ligation. The right fallopian tube was grasped with a Babcock and identified by its fimbriated end.  A small defect was made in the mesosalpinx below the grasped segment.  The tube was then doubly ligated with 0-Gut suture and the intervening segment excised.  The remaining tubal segments were hemostatic.  The same procedure was repeated on the left fallopian tube.  Portions of both tubes were passed off the surgical field and sent to pathology. The Alexis O-Ring retractor was removed.  The fascia was inspected superiorly and inferiorly and was found to be intact and hemostatic.  A Fish visceral retainer was placed below the level of the fascia to ensure safe closure.  The fascia was closed with 2 sutures of 0-Vicryl starting at the angles and running in a continuous fashion to meet the midline. The Fish retractor was removed prior to final fascial  Closure.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and made hemostatic with cautery.  The subcutaneous tissue was closed in 2 layers with 2-0 Vicryl.  The first layer contained interrupted sutures and the second layer was running.  The skin was closed with a running subcuticular stitch of 3-0 Monocryl.  Steri strips and a Bioguard dressing were applied.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.

"Lactation Note: Mom had the baby swaddled in her arms when I entered her room. The baby was awake and showing feeding cues. I offered mom to help her with latching the baby onto the breast, she said that the baby was not hungry because he lets her know when he is hungry when he grabs her breast. I taught her the feeding cues and asked if I could assess(touch) her breast and with her permission I taught her how to do hand expression but she kept making sounds of pain before I could massage her breast. I got a couple of drop from her right breast and nothing from the left nipple. I tried to latch the baby onto the breast and the baby would not latch. Mom became upset and said that her baby was not hungry. I reminded her that it was 10:30 am and the baby last breast fed at 6:00 am. I used the 20 mm nipple shield she had in the room and I cleaned with soap and hot water and she got upset that I cleaned it because she did not want the baby to get soap and she said the nipple shield was sterile. Mom instructed that it is important to clean the nipple shield after every use. I changed the nipple shield size to a 16 mm.I tried to hand express her colostrum to the tip of the nipple shield and she kept c/o that this was not done yesterday and the baby breast fed well. I asked mom to show me how she positions and latches the baby onto the breast. Mom place the baby in a cradle hold with the hands in front of him, his body facing the ceiling as he sucked on the tip of the nipple shied. Mom instructed to face the baby  towards her and she just kept the baby in the incorrect position. I encouraged mom to try the football hold. I helped her and the baby would not stayed latched onto the breast and she thought the baby was not hungry. I helped re- latch the baby onto the breast in a football hold, and I made her aware that the baby was having difficulty with breastfeeding . Mom states that she is worried that he is not eating and that may she should use formula or pump and bottle feed. When the baby was placed facing her; she c/o the baby's clamp hurting her and when I asked her to hold her baby to breast feed she threw her head back on the pillow in frustration, and she said she was tired and the baby was not hungry. I made her aware that I was going to let the doctor know about the breastfeeding issues.I spoke to her  Nurse Ashly and case manager(social worker) I told them that I am concerned about the baby's safety, from what I was able to assess mom does not have the capacity, or the level of intelligence to understand the consequences of not feeding the baby or sleeping with the baby in her arms as already observed. She needs to be supervised as she takes care of her baby. The baby's face had a yellow appearance and slight petechiae noted on his forehead. Md [**NAME**] aware and he agreed that maybe it would be safer for mom to bottle feed. The patient's nurse made me aware that mom is not able to express any milk via pumping.

"This note was copied from the chart of BOY/Gala Olaciregui. Lactation:  Lengthy feeding assistance by RN request for difficult latch.  Babe is s/p frenotomy.  Feeding challenges during this consult were thus: 1) the mother has very large, heavy and pendulous breasts, 2) the mother's nipple anatomy is larger than average in diameter, short, and with minimal protractility, 3) baby has a recessed chin, and 4) baby is s/p frenotomy with poor suck organization that has improved slightly with much clinical support.  Mother stated early in the consult that she wants very much to breastfeed her baby, emphasizing that she is ""willing to do whatever it takes.""  Mother is employed by [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] as a coder.    Feeding assessment:   Suck training was provided to baby following initial difficulty with latch, and baby's suck showed slow but gradual improvement in organization at the breast via much clinical support re: breast compression toward baby's mouth to stimulate the suck reflex.   Mother was assisted in using a medical-grade electric breastpump to stimulate/further protract her nipples, and this was effective for several minutes in further protracting the nipple tissue, though the nipples soon returned to a shorter length.  Mother was assisted in positioning her baby in football hold and cradle holds, and a rolled up sheet was placed under the breasts to provide enough lift of the nipple toward the baby versus the natural downward slant of the nipple due to very large and pendulous breasts.  Baby was assisted with latch with and without the nipple shield, and baby's lengthiest success was with the 24mm nipple shield, although baby did display less than 5 minutes of suckling behavior on the L breast without the nipple shield, following several minutes of pumping to protract the nipple tissue.  Baby cluster-fed back and forth between the breasts many times, and either saliva or a very small amount of clear colostrum was noted in the tip of the nipple shield over the course of a lengthy consult.  The mother did not release any drops of colostrum during the pumping session, although the L nipple became well-protracted with pumping, but only briefly.  As the cluster-feed progressed when baby was able to latch without the nipple shield, the mother's L nipple had a horizontally creased compression mark after baby nursed for several minutes in the football hold.  The lengthy breastfeeding practice session ended via tube-feeding formula at the breast with tubing inserted into the corner of baby's mouth.  Even with tube-feeding at the breast, suckling was not yet highly organized.    Patient teaching:  Mother was instructed in the use of the medical-grade electric breastpump in order to help her nipples to become more protractile to help baby with latch, and in order to provide her breasts with adequate stimulation due to early nipple shield use.  We discussed several studies, including a 2015 study, that have correlated early nipple shield use with poor infant weight gain and shorter duration of breastfeeding.  We discussed one study that did not find any correlation with early nipple shield use and shorter duration of breastfeeding, as well as another important study that found preterm infants could transfer greater volumes of milk from the breast using a nipple shield, and lesser volumes of milk from the breast without the support of a nipple shield, although the mothers of these preterm infants had been expressing their milk for their preterm infants for some time prior to breastfeeding practice.  Due to the above studies, mother was advised to pump for 15 minutes after any feed in which baby requires the nipple shield for the time being, and mother was given the option to pump prior to feeding in order to protract her nipples, whether or not baby needs the support of the nipple shield to latch and suckle.    For Pediatrics:  Even though mother is recovering from a vaginal birth, an additional day of inpatient infant feeding support will likely be of great benefit to both mother and baby.

"Mom states the baby has not breast fed for 6 hours :mom is having difficulty waking the baby up. I woke the baby up and assessed the baby's tongue because of the trauma noted on the nipples.the baby has tight frenulum, MD Knickerbocker made aware. Mom had refused the frenotomy because she was afraid of hurting the baby. She was anxious and began to cry ; mom reassured that this procedure was not  critical and I described the procedure. I helped mom latch the baby onto the breast in a football hold, the baby started out chomping then went into a rhythmic suck. Mom cried when I latched the baby onto the breast. I took the baby off and asked mom how she wanted to feed the baby,because the baby has not been fed since the early am. Mom decided to re-latch the baby and she did some breathing when she initially latched the baby onto the breast. The baby does have a good latch and a nutritive suck.",1

"Called regarding patient well known to the neurosurgery service.  Ms. [**NAME**] is a very pleasant 25 yo female with known posterior cervical hemangioma. Patient is currently in her 3rd trimester of pregnancy. She remains asymptomatic at rest. On exam she has symmetric motor exam with 5/5 strength and intact sensation. However upon valsalva patient develops symptoms of bilateral lower extremity numbness and posterior lumbar spine and lower extremity paresthesias consistent with Lhermitte's phenomenon. Because of the onset of the symptoms with minimal straining, this suggests that normal child labor would increase risk of spinal cord injury when compared to a cesarean section.   Discussed with patient and primary team. Will discuss risks of both to the patient. In either case would strongly recommend avoiding hypotension during delivery and perform physical/neurologic exam after delivery.

"Lactation Note The pt was sitting up and holding Raediance [twin B] on her chest when I saw her today. The baby was not STS so I provided encouragement and discussed with her the benefits of practicing STS with both of her daughters. She was receptive to the information.

I reviewed her [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] Breast feeding booklet as she wasn't able to remember some of the information from the previous day. She was able to demonstrate breast massage and hand expression. She understands the importance of breast feeding prior to pumping as she wants to pump to build her milk supply. RaeLynn [twin A] was asleep in the crib and the pt states she gave her formula about two hours prior to my visit because she was still crying after nursing and the pt was concerned about her supply. The pt states that she has concerns R/T a possible tongue in RaeLynn and wants to speak to the pediatrician about it tomorrow.I reinforced the supply and demand process of milk production and encouraged her to allow the baby to nurse unrestricted until she is satisfied. The pt revealed difficulty with obtaining a breast pump from WIC and states she intends to F/U after D/C. In the mean time she states she had to purchase one on her own. I reviewed the details of a nutritive latch, the I&O pages of the resource book and what red flags to report after D/C home.

I inquired about her comfort level and she replied that she was not comfortable. I offered assistance which she readily accepted. The baby was held while she repositioned herself and removed her upper clothing to promote STS. The breasts were massaged and colostrum was expressed from both breasts. The nipples are well everted but very reddened and sore. The baby has a frenulum but intermittently is able to extend his tongue. He was noted to bite my gloved finger while sucking rhythmically. The baby was placed back on the left breast in a football hold with a deep latch using the nipple to nose practice. The baby was observed by both parents to suck consistently with his lips at a 90 degree angle. Pillows were used to improve the baby's body alignment and the mothers comfort.

"This note was copied from the chart of BOY/[**NAME**]. Lactation:  Two visits were provided today, with patient teaching on early to advanced hunger cues and offering baby the breast during early hunger, for easiest learning by baby.  Mother states baby can latch and nurse on the right breast, and RN reports baby has nursed independently on the right, but the mother states, ""He comes off in a few minutes and cries.""  The mother stated her perception that baby is still hungry, and we discussed again offering the same breast and/or offering the other breast, and continuing to go back and forth between breasts until baby is full, with the rationale of multiple milk releases from the breast.  Female visitors were present during my second visit, and one of the visitors was holding baby in one arm and a bottle of formula in the other hand.    Mother denied nipple soreness or nipple pain with breastfeeding thus far.  We discussed the common learning behavior in newborns that follows the use of an artificial nipple, and particularly the early use of an artificial nipple re: difficulty with latch and/or sucking at the breast.  Mother was encouraged to offer baby the breast in response to baby's early hunger cues, and to request any needed assistance from the nursing staff as well as the breastfeeding specialists, until baby is nursing well for all feeds as the mother wishes.    Mother was provided with a pump kit at her request and at the request of the nursing staff, and a pump demonstration of the manual pump was also provided.  The baby is reported to now be nursing well on one breast, and mother was reassured that many babies learn how to latch onto one breast a day or more before learning how to latch onto the other breast.

"Lactation note: I met this pt this morning to offer her assistance with breast pumping. She verbalized a strong desire to give her baby breast milk while he is in the NICU because she ""knows he needs it"". She also states she does not intend to continue breast feeding when he is a little older. She states she has only pumped randomly about six times since his birth. I assured her that my job is to support her decision and assist her in developing her milk supply. I instructed her on breast massage and hand expression and provided her a handout for education reinforcement. After performing breast massage she had a drop of visible colostrum in her right breast. I educated her on proper cleaning of her pump supplies and encouraged her to take all her supplies with her at D/C to continue using in the NICU pumping room. The breast pump was attached to her breasts and placed on the premie setting. The pt is using a 27 mm flange on both breasts and denies any discomfort with their use. Her nipples are slightly flat but evert with the breast pump suction. I instructed her to use the premie setting for the full 15 minutes and to pump consistently every 2-2.5 hours during the day and at least once during the night and early morning when her prolactin level is high. The pt has some eyesight compromise and verbalizes that it is difficult for her to see. After placing her bed down on the lowest level I encouraged her to call for assistance whenever she needs it. She plans to visit the NICU after she finishes pumping. I noted the numer for the WIC office on her pumping packet and instructed her to call them to notify them of her baby's birth and her plan to breast feed. She is hoping to stay at the [**NAME**] House after her DC.",3

"ATTENDING OPERATIVE NOTE  Date of Surgery: [**DATE**]  Preoperative Diagnosis: 1. IUP at 38 6/7 weeks 2. Prior low transverse cesarean- declines trial of labor 3. Grand Multiparity 4. Desire for elective sterilization   Postoperative Diagnosis: Same  Operation Performed: 1. Repeat low transverse cesarean 2. Pomeroy BTI   Surgeon: [**NAME**]  Assistant: [**NAME**] MS IV  Anesthesiologist Gravenstein  Anesthesia: Epidural   Procedure:   Prior to the start of surgery, a time-out was taken, and the patient's identity and operative procedure were verified.  The peritoneal cavity then was entered without complication through the patient's previous Pfannensteil incision.  The lower uterine segment was identified, and the bladder flap was created by sharp and blunt dissection.  A horizontal incision was made in the lower uterine segment, and the infant was delivered from a cephalic presentation without difficulty.  The baby was a  3799 gram  female and had Apgar scores of 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively.  The  venous cord blood gas was 7.32. The arterial cord blood gas was not obtained. The placenta was removed by gentle traction on the umbilical cord.  It was intact, and the cord had 3 vessels.  The myometrium then was closed in two layers using continuous sutures of 0-Vicryl.  The pericolic gutters were carefully irrigated.  The fascial edges then were re-approximated with two continuous sutures of 0-Vicryl.  The wound was  irrigated, and the lower half of the subcutaneous tissue was re-approximated with a running suture of 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin edges were re-approximated with an intracuticular suture of 3-0 Monocryl.  The estimated blood loss during surgery was 800 ml, and the patient received 1800 ml of lactated ringer's solution.  At the conclusion of the procedure, the sponge count and needle count were correct.  The neonate was transported to the newborn nursery in good condition, and the mother was transported to the recovery room, also in good condition.  The patient received an injection of cefazolin plus azithromycin to reduce the risk of postoperative infection.  [**NAME**], M.D. Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology",1

The baby was able to suck several times before losing his latch. We re latched him a few times before discussing her use of a 24 mm nipple shield. I demonstrated the correct way to apply it to her breast and discussed when she should use it on a temporary basis. The baby was asleep by this time, redressed and placed back in his crib for his PKU and Hep B vaccination. The pt was educated about the benefits of breast massage and hand expression as well as the frequent practice of STS. She expressed a desire to attend the [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] mothers breast feeding support group so she was given an invitation to attend.

The perineum was cleansed with betadine at the beginning of the repair, periodically throughout the repair, and at the end of the repair. Each free end of the capsule was grasped with an Allis clamp. Four figure of eight sutures of 0- vicryl were used to reapproximate the capsule. A running locking suture of 2-0 chromic was used to close the vaginal tissue defect beginning at the apex and continuing to the hymenal ring. A crown suture was placed. The dead space between either side of the laceration was closed with 2-0 chromic, and the skin was reapproximated using a subcuticular suture of 2-0 vicryl.  At the completion of the procedure, a rectal exam was performed and there were no defects noted. There was no suture in the rectum.   An xray was performed due to incorrect lap count. The Xray resulted as ""No evidence for retained sponge markers.""  H [**NAME**]  MD",0
"Lactation F/U note: I returned to see this pt per her request to assist with latching and positioning. The baby was STS and readily latched on with the cross cradle position and some finger stimulation. A wide open mouth was obtained with the nipple to nose technique and baby was brought close and latched immediately. Deep sucks and rhythmic jaw movements were noted and milk transfer was observed and the pt stated she could feel the deep sucking but denied any pain or burning. I commended her technique and the successful latch which was obtained without the aide of the nipple shield. The pt was encouraged to continue feeding the baby and to stimulate him intermittently if he falls asleep with physical touch and breast compressions. Continue to support and assist as needed.

Liveborn infant female weighing 3456 grams with Apgars of 8 and 9.  Indication: [**NAME**] is a 26 y.o. female para 0 who was admitted with spontaneous rupture of membranes at 3/C/-1. She was started on pitocin and progressed to 5/C/0 but did not progress further despite adequate uterine contractions on pitocin. She developed chorioamnionitis and was started on antibiotics. After 5 hours of no cervical change she was agreeable to delivery via cesarean section.   Procedure: After satisfactory anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped in a routine fashion for abdominal surgery.  Time-out confirmed patient and procedure.  The abdomen was entered with a Pfannensteil approach.  A bladder flap was created and then a transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and extended laterally with the surgeon's fingers.  Amniotic fluid was cloudy white.  The above described infant was delivered from the cephalic presentation.  The cord was clamped and cut and the baby handed to the pediatrician.  Blood for gases and DNA was obtained.  The placenta was delivered with cord traction.  The uterus was wiped out with a lap.  The uterus was closed in a double layer closure using 0-monocryl. The first layer was sewn in a running locked fashion from angle to angle. The second layer was an imbricating layer sewn across the hysterotomy. The fascia was closed with 1 suture of 0-Vicryl starting at the angle and running in a continuous fashion. The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and reapproximated with a single running stitch of 3-0 vicryl.  The skin was closed with 4-0 monocryl in an intracuticular fashion.  Steristrips (without benzoin) were applied and an OpSite dressing was applied.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.  [**NAME**]  Dictated for [**NAME**] MD  I was present for the entire case.

I reinforced the need to breast feed baby and reduce the amount of formula being used, and to continue pumping to soften the nipples for latching. Mother has also been using a small nipple shield on the right nipple, however, it is too small for her nipple. I provided a 24 mm shield for her.

"I met with MOB in her room on Unit 95. MOB is known to me from sw involvement while she was admitted to L&D (see sw note from [**DATE**]). MOB noted that her three older children are in the care of a family member, but she is not yet certain how long they will be able to remain in the family member's care. She also expressed uncertainty re: DCF case and additional support that may be offered. MOB denied significant history with the Department. Of note, DCF investigator, [**NAME**], who met with MOB on [**DATE**] reported no concerns re: MOB.   MOB advised that, depending on the length of baby's hospitalization, she may need to return to [**LOCATION_CITY**] to provide care for her children and visit her baby as she is able. We discussed RMH and MOB requested placement on the waiting list, advising that older children may stay with her there until they have to return to school from the winter break on [**DATE**]. I placed MOB in the list and provided guidance for calling daily to confirm her reservation.  MOB lost a baby to SIDS in [**DATE**]. She became tearful discussing this, advising that he had been asleep in his crib when she found him and called 911. MOB shared has mostly worked through the grief of this loss, but still feels sad at times, including his birthday and the date of his death. I validated this emotional response and provided brief supportive counseling. We also discussed increased risk for PPD given this loss and the stress of her baby's condition and hospitalization. I encouraged follow up with her OB/GYN as needed should symptoms arise. MOB is also enrolled in Healthy Start and has counseling resources available through this program.  MOB has very limited support at this time. She advised that all of her family in [**LOCATION_CITY**] are busy with work and their own children. MOB also noted that she and [**NAME**], are not in a relationship at this time, although she does anticipate he will be involved to some extent in baby's life. It is unlikely that FOB will be able to come sign birth certificate, but MOB stated that she would like him to be on it and that she also intends to pursue child support. I provided guidance for requesting birth certificate amendment.   MOB received limited prenatal care due to transportation issues. We discussed the importance of resolving transportation barriers so that baby can be seen at all recommended medical appointments. I provided information re: Medicaid transportation for this. MOB also reported a plan to obtain a vehicle upon receipt of her income tax return.   MOB resides with her three children and the family is supported by income from MOB's job, child support and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.

"This note was copied from the chart of GIRL/[**NAME**]. Lactation:  Consult by mother's request on day of discharge home.  Mother has severe nipple and areolar damage on the right, and mother reports this began in the operating room when baby latched onto the breast.  Mother is a registered nurse who works in a correctional facility for mentally ill prisoners, and states she has been provided with a high-end retail breastpump by her health insurance company.  Mother reports bringing this breastpump and using it during this hospital stay, but reports pain when pumping, particularly on the right.    Mother has a history of bilateral breast augmentation.    Yesterday lactation nurse [**NAME**] reported that she had changed mother's breast shield on the mother's retail breastpump from a 24mm to a 27mm shield, due to the mother's nipple and areolar damage.    Lactation history:  Mother reports she expressed her milk and exclusively bottle-fed her 5 y/o child for 6 months, following the difficulty of unsuccessful breastfeeding attempts.   Maternal breast assessment:  Breasts are medium to large (with augmentation) on this small mother's frame, rounded, closely spaced and symmetrical.  Nipple anatomy is very large in diameter bilaterally, and the L nipple is partially inverted though protracted at the base, as well as nonreddened and intact.  Nipple anatomy on the right is protracted but short, and reddened with an arc'd bruise at the most distal aspect of the nipple from 12 o'clock to 5 o'clock.   The L areola is nonreddened and intact, although the right areola is severely reddened, more so along the superior aspect of the right areola.  There is a partial thickness Stage III areolar wound at 11 o'clock proximal to the nipple, 1 mm x  2mm in diameter.    Feeding assessment:  Mother was assisted in positioning her baby in cross-cradle and cradle holds on the L side, and baby was unable to latch without the support of a 24mm nipple shield.  With the 24mm nipple shield, baby latched with minimal guidance, then nursed in an appropriately rhythmic manner with appropriate jaw excursions for approximately 10 minutes.  Baby slept briefly, then was assisted in the football hold on the right.  Remarkably, given the extent of the mother's nipple damage, she was able to comfortably tolerate the feeding on the right by using the 24mm nipple shield.    Interventions and patient teaching:  Mother was provided with a medical-grade electric breastpump to give her the superior experience of the medical-grade EBP for her comfort, and mother reported a painless pumping experience using custom 36mm breast shields, versus the 27mm breast shields that she reports receiving yesterday.  Mother was given information on medical-grade electric breastpump rentals as needed.  A USP-grade lanolin product was provided to the mother, and she applied this to the wounded right nipple and areola.  Mother inquired about using the breast shells provided to her yesterday, reporting that she is using one breast shell on the right for her nipple wounds, and is using the breast shell on the L to further protract the partial inversion of that nipple.  As the breast shell attachment for inverted nipples is significantly smaller than the mother's nipple diameter, mother was advised that she may wear the breast shell on the L with the soreness attachment as needed, although that nipple has no visible injuries at present.     We discussed recent (2015) and past studies correlating early nipple shield use with poor infant weight gain and shorter duration of breastfeeding.  We discussed one study that showed an increased transfer of milk from the breast by preterm infants using a nipple shield, in which the mothers of the preterm infants had been previously pumping to build their milk supplies prior to the preterm infants going to the breast.  We discussed another study on nipple shield use in which no correlation was found re: poor infant weight gain or shorter duration of breastfeeding.  I shared my own professional experiences in lactation of seeing more babies with slow/poor weight gain when a mother has not been pumping at all from birth during early nipple shield use, as well as seeing fewer babies who are using a nipple shield with appropriate weight gain whose mothers have never pumped since birth.     Due to the published risks of early nipple shield use, mother was advised to pump after nursing at least 6 times daily until baby shows a pattern of consistent weight gain, then to gradually reduce her pumpings by dropping one pumping every 2 to 3 days, while giving baby unrestricted access to the breast and monitoring baby's I & O re: counting number of daily feeds for at least 8 to 12 feeds daily, and following the feeding diary with the listed expected daily output from [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**]'s breastfeeding handbook.  Mother's RN background was emphasized re: monitoring baby's I & O.   We reviewed the contact information on regional infant nutrition resources from [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**]'s breastfeeding handbook, including lactation consultants [**NAME**] with [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**]'s Center for Breastfeeding and Newborns, and [**NAME**], who is in private practice.  Mother was encouraged to call for assistance as needed, and to call with any questions or concerns.    [**NAME**], RN BSN IBCLC Lactation Consultant",3

"Assessment: Pt feels breastfeeding has been difficult at times, is concerned with infant weight loss now as 11% below birth weight. She has very little confidence in her ability to latch infant well.  Infant is currently latched and nursing in cradle position on left breast - nipple-only latch noted, chin away from breast, torso facing ceiling.  Pt states her nipples are very sore. Breasts are soft, round, filling.  Nipples are everted, bilateral abrasions c/w ineffective latch.  Pt was taught how to hand express her breasts, and multiple drops of colostrum noted bilaterally. States she was unable to BF her other children for very long, admits she had very little support.  Determined to nurse this infant for at least 6 months. Infant EBF at this time.  Intervention: Assisted pt to reposition and latch infant in clutch hold on left breast with deep asymmetrical latch and rhythmic suck/ audible swallow.  Pt reports much less discomfort with latch, very pleased.  Discussed importance of asymmetrical, chin-led latch, as well as allowing infant to determine feeding times by observing infant for feeding cues.  Instructed to allow infant to finish on one breast, using breast compressions to maximize feeding time before switching to second breast at each feeding.  Reviewed nipple care, typical cluster feeding behavior, infant stomach capacity and expected output for infant. Discouraged use of pacifiers or artificial nipples until breastfeeding is well-established, around 3-4 weeks of age. Encouraged maximizing skin to skin time with infant over the next several days as well.  Pt was able to unlatch/ relatch infant x2 during visit, gaining confidence.  Pt provided with a copy of the [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] Breastfeeding book and made aware of resources available to her after discharge.  Pt plans to return to work most likely after 12 weeks. Discussed obtaining a pump and reviewed recommended milk storage guidelines.   Plan: Will continue to support pt's breastfeeding goals.

When I came to evaluate the patient she was sitting very calmly on the bed with a friend beside her (someone she has known for years from pediatric adolescent palliative care) and although tearful at times seemed appropriately upset and was cooperative. She denied any suicidal or homicidal thoughts and stated that she felt very safe, just felt she had been wronged by some of the people here. She is very upset by the fact that she thinks she has been misrepresented in medical records portraying her as noncompliant. I told the patient I was very sorry to hear what she is going through and just want to be sure that she is in a safe place mentally right now with everything that she has learned today but that I would not be able to addend her medical record or comment further as I have not been taking care of the patient throughout her stay.

"Lactation support and assistance: The pt had her baby resting across her abdomen with his mouth latched only on the nipple portion of a 24 mm nipple shield. I suggested that he be repositioned to improve both her comfort and to obtain a deeper latch. She requested that we try him without the nipple shield. The baby was placed STS on his abdomen tummy to chest with the pt. Her nipple was erect and the baby easily latched on with a deep asymmetric latch. I provided her with education regarding breast massage and hand expression. The pt had several lumps and knots in both breasts which I massaged with warm wash clothes and performed breast compressions while the baby displayed consistent and rhythmic sucking and swallowing. Milk was easily expressed from both breasts between nursing episodes. I encouraged frequent STS with the pt and the FOB. Feeding cues and feeding on demand at least 8-10 times/24hours was strongly reinforced. The [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] Breastfeeding book was provided and all successful lactation details were reviewed. I discussed the football nursing position and the pt verbalized satisfaction with using it. I explained the details of a nutritive latch, baby's daily feeding log, and important outpatient resources. I inquired about nipple pain or discomfort during or after breastfeeding. I provided her with a hospital grade electric pump and demonstrated it's use. The FOB assisted with the pumping process and participated in the cleaning and assembly of the pumping supplies. The pt had approximately 10 ml's of breast milk after about 10 minutes of pumping on the preemie cycle. I demonstrated the use of the hand pump and encouraged her to continue performing breast massage and compressions while nursing and to allow the bay to empty her breasts while nursing him on each side with each nursing session. I also recommended that she pump to completely empty her breasts if the baby is not able to in the beginning of his growth and development. I congratulated them both on the baby's birth and encouraged F/U with a lactation counselor for any further concerns with engorgement or breast feeding.  [**NAME**] RN, BSN, CLC",3

She has had myoclonic jerks however, most recent one in the past 24 hours.  Pt's keppra level can go down during pregnancy. For this reason we would recommend increasing keppra to 2000mg BID. We would recommend checking keppra levels and zonegran levels monthly through out pregnancy as this can vary with pregnancy. These will take a few days to result. We would also recommend that the pt be continued on 4mg of folic acid thorough out her pregnancy.  Would also avoid benzo for treatment myoclonic jerks.

Procedure: After satisfactory anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped in a routine fashion for abdominal surgery. Time-out confirmed patient and procedure. The abdomen was entered with a Pfannensteil approach.  The superior aspect of the fascial incision was grasped upward and the underlying rectus muscle was dissected away with a combination of sharp and blunt dissection.  Attention was then turned to the inferior aspect which was grasped upward and underlying rectus muscles were dissected away with sharp dissection.  The rectus muscles were separated in the midline and the peritoneum was entered with blunt dissection while maintaining visualization of the bowel and bladder.  A bladder flap was made.  A low transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and extended laterally.  Amniotic fluid was clear. The above described infant was delivered from the cephalic presentation. The cord was clamped and the cord was cut and the baby handed to the pediatrician who was present for delivery. Blood for gases and DNA was obtained. The placenta was delivered with cord traction.   The uterus was cleared of clots and debris. The uterus was exteriorized. The uterus was closed with a two layer closure; initial layer was a 0-vicryl locking layer; the second layer was an imbricating layer of 0-vicryl.  The uterus was replaced into the patient's abdomen. The hysterotomy was hemostatic as was the fascia and rectus muscles.  The fascia was closed with 0-Vicryl starting at the angle and running in a continuous fashion. The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated with normal saline and was found to be hemostatic. The subcutaneous tissue was reapproximated with 3-0 vicryl.  The skin was closed with with 0-monocryl. Dermabond was applied. The vagina was cleared of clots. All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.    [**NAME**]",0

"Lactation Note The pt was sitting in her chair by the window with her baby draped across her lap. The baby was undressed as she had just completed a breastfeeding session. The baby was asleep and very calm.  Assessment: I was unable to perform a breast assessment or baby assessment at this time. The pt denies any breast or nipple pain. She reports not having enough milk and is supplementing with formula for that reason. She admits to performing hand expression but not breast massage. Intervention: The pt was educated about the benefits of breast massage, hand expression and the frequent practice of STS. Frequent demand feedings in response to feeding cues was discussed and encouraged with a minimum of 8-10 breast feeding occurences in each 24 hour cycle. The [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] Breastfeeding book was provided and reviewed. Lactation F/U resources were recommended for ongoing support and assistance and contact information was noted in the back of the book. Monitoring of adequate nutrition using the baby's weight, frequency and duration of feedings, and adequate elimination patterns each day was emphasized and close observation encouraged. The baby's daily feeding record was noted and instructions for utilizing it as a tracking system for progress at home was recommended. The pt's questions were addressed while the risks of supplementing with formula and using pacifiers was discussed. The pt was encouraged to continue demand feedings without time restrictions and supplement only after the baby has completed her feeding.     Plan: Continue to provide lactation support and assistance to help the pt meet her breastfeeding goals. Reinforce cluster feeding as a newborn behavior that increases breast stimulation, increased milk production and typically indicates a growth spurt.   [**NAME**] BSN, CLC",3

The peritoneal cavity then was entered without complication through a  Pfannensteil incision.  The lower uterine segment was identified, and the bladder flap was created by sharp and blunt dissection.  A horizontal incision was made in the lower uterine segment, and the infant was delivered from a cephalic presentation without difficulty.  The baby was a  3 pound, 2 ounce female and had Apgar scores of 9 and 10 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively.  The arterial and venous cord blood gases are pending at this time. The placenta was removed by gentle traction on the umbilical cord.  It was intact, and the cord had 3 vessels.  The myometrium then was closed in two layers using continuous sutures of 0-Vicryl.  The pericolic gutters were carefully irrigated.  The fascial edges then were re-approximated with two continuous sutures of 0-Vicryl.  The wound was  irrigated, and the lower half of the subcutaneous tissue was re-approximated with a running suture of 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin edges were re-approximated with an intracuticular suture of 3-0 Monocryl.  The estimated blood loss during surgery was 800 ml, and the patient received 700 ml of lactated ringer's solution.  At the conclusion of the procedure, the sponge count and needle count were correct.  The neonate was transported to the newborn nursery in good condition, and the mother was transported to the recovery room, also in good condition.

Normal uterus.  Tubes and ovaries not inspected due to significant intraperitoneal adhesions preventing access to the adnexa bilaterally.  Significant adhesions between the anterior uterus in the upper segment and the anterior abdominal wall.  Liveborn infant male weighing 3742 grams with Apgars of 9 and 9.  Indication: [**NAME**] is a 19 y.o. female para 1031 who presented to L&D triage at 41w3d gestation with decreased FM.  Noted to have reactive NST.  H/O limited prenatal care due to multiple moves during pregnancy, no care since 30 weeks.  Due to late term gestation, complaints of decreased FM, h/o prior c/s x1, and suspected macrosomia (measured 4300g on growth sono in triage) - plans were made for repeat cesarean delivery.  Pt declined BTI and plans depo postpartum.  Procedure: After satisfactory anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped in a routine fashion for abdominal surgery.  Time-out confirmed patient and procedure.  The abdomen was entered with a Pfannenstiel approach and dissected down to the level of the fascia with sharp dissection and cautery. The fascia was scored in the midline and extended laterally with sharp dissection. The anterior leaf of the fascia was grasped upwards and the underlying rectus muscle was dissected with sharp and blunt dissection. This was also performed inferiorly. The rectus muscles were separated in the midline and the peritoneum was entered and the underlying uterus exposed.  On entry into the peritoneal, significant adhesions were noted between the anterior uterus in the upper segment and the anterior abdominal wall.  A small tear in the uterine serosa was made while examining adhesions, which was later repaired.  Fetal position was confirmed.  The lower uterine segement identified and found to be clear of adhesions.  A bladder flap was created.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and extended laterally with blunt dissection.  Amniotic fluid was clear at the time of rupture.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation and gave a spontaneous cry.  The cord was clamped and cut and the baby handed to the pediatrician.  Blood for gases and DNA was obtained then cord blood donation was performed.  The placenta was delivered with cord traction.  The uterus was not able to be exteriorized due to significant adhesions, but was instead left in place and wiped out with a lap.  The uterus was closed in a single running locked layer closure using 0-Monocryl. The area of torn serosa identified during peritoneal entry was repaired with a running stitch of 2-0 Vicryl and found to be hemostatic. The uterine incision was carefully inspected, found to be hemostatic, and uterine tone was adequate. The fascia was inspected superiorly and inferiorly and was found to be intact and hemostatic.  The fascia was closed with 1 suture of 0-Vicryl starting at the angle and running in a continuous fashion to the opposite angle. The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and closed with 4 interrupted sutures of 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with a running subcuticular stitch of 4-0 Monocryl.  Dermabond was applied.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  There were no identified complications.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.   [**NAME**]",0

"This note was copied from the chart of BOY/[**NAME**]. Lactation:  Follow-up consult by parents' request for fussy baby not latching.  Baby had been sleepy today following circumcision, although mother reports one brief 4-minute feed as well as one 40-minute feed post-circumcision.    Maternal breast assessment:  Breasts are medium to large in size, closely spaced, heavy, and asymmetrical re: L breast distinctly smaller than the right.  Mother reports that baby's recent 40-minute feeding took place on this now-smaller breast.    Feeding assessment:  After placing the baby in skin-to-skin contact with the mother, the mother was assisted in positioning her baby in football hold on the right breast, although only minimal guidance was needed by the mother for positioning her baby to feed.  Mother was then assisted in helping her baby with latch, and baby was able to sustain the latch after a few unsuccessful attempts, then displayed rhythmic suckling with audible swallows.  Baby nursed for 10+ minutes into a deeply relaxed state re: limp arms and deep sleep. Baby did not require the support of any nipple shield during this feed.    Patient teaching:  Light breast compression was discussed with the mother in order to help baby sustain the latch more quickly, and we also discussed the frequent loss of latch and difficulty with latch following the use of an artificial nipple, and particularly the early use of an artificial nipple.  Parents acknowledged that baby has used a pacifier, and the grandmother was holding a pacifier attached to a soft toy animal.  We discussed the frequent skill decay for breastfeeding re: difficulty with latch following the use of an artificial nipple, particularly during a baby's skill acquisition for latch, since babies learn to correlate the smell, touch, and taste of the maternal nipple with suckling and the receipt of milk, versus learning to correlate the smell, touch, and taste of an artificial nipple with suckling.  Parents and grandmother were open to this discussion in a highly positive manner.    Mother was encouraged to offer baby the breast in early hunger, when latch is easier to learn.  Mother was further encouraged to call for assistance as desired, and to call with any questions or concerns.  [**NAME**], RN BSN IBCLC Lactation Consultant",1

Delivered by :  Primary Low Transverse Cesarean Section B-Lynch Stitch Bilateral Parkland Tubal Interruption  Hospital Course:  [**NAME**] is a 38 y.o. female para 0311 who presented to L&D at 28w5d gestation wit PPROM. Her other prenatal complications are listed under pre-operative diagnoses above. For further details see admission H&P from [**DATE**]. She was admitted and started on Mg for neuroprotection. She had recently received a BMS course (completed [**DATE**]) therefore this was not initially repeated. She was stable for approximately 36 hours although FHR tracing showed occasional decelerations and segments of decreased variability. On [**DATE**] she developed increasingly painful contractions. On exam the cervix was noted to be 4cm dilated with the cerclage pulling through. Additionally, she was found to have purulent vaginal discharge and fundal tenderness. Given overall clinical picture concerning for chorioamnionitis, the stitch was removed and she was started on antibiotic treatment. After several hours, the cervix was dilated to only 6cm, therefore she was also augmented with pitocin. Over the next 4 hours, no significant cervical change occurred. The FHR tracing showed decreased variability and more frequent decelerations. Given nonreassuring fetal heart rate tracing with minimal BTBV, small accelerations, and early vs late decelerations, despite conservative intrauterine measures in the setting of likely chorioamnionitis plan was made to proceed with cesarean section at this time. It was confirmed that the patient still desired tubal ligation regardless of the outcome of the pregnancy. Postoperatively the pt is doing well. By POD2 she was able to ambulate, void, and tolerate a regular diet.Her suagrs werre well ctonrolled on AM: 18nph/15R and PM: 15NPH/7R Her pain was well controlled and her lochia was less than menses.

"Lactation:  Consult by RN request for maternal complaints of bleeding nipples, although RN states that she did not observe any bleeding upon exam.    Mother states that she does not have nipple pain when baby latches, ""but then it starts hurting when she starts sliding down on it.""    Lactation history:  Mother states she did not breastfeed her first child, who is now 2 years old:  ""I didn't even think about it.""    Maternal breast exam:  Breasts are medium in size, closely spaced, rounded and symmetrical.  Both nipples have transverse compression bruises/stripes along the tips, but are otherwise nonreddened and intact.    Infant assessment for feeding readiness:  Infant is in a deep sleep on mother's chest.  Mother declined to wake baby for feeding in order to practice improved technique, preferring to wait until baby wakens independently.    Patient teaching:  Discussed bringing baby in closer to the breast (chin on breast, cheeks touching breast) in response to pain at any point in the feeding.  If this slight re-positioning does not resolve the nipple pain, mother was advised to interrupt baby's latch when pain continues by safely releasing baby from the breast in order to avoid further nipple trauma.  Baby can then be relatched, and almost always, babies open wider for a relatch.  Babies frequently end the feed by releasing the latch, while at other times babies slide down on the tip of the nipple, pulling the nipple as they learn how to come off the breast.  Releasing baby's latch was again recommended to the mother in order to protect her nipple integrity.  Mother has the Medela TenderCare lanolin product and was encouraged to use this after nursing, and to otherwise let pain be her guide and relatch baby as needed.    In response to mother's earlier request to her nurse for bottles and/or pump, extensive teaching was provided on the nature of the frequent breastfeeding difficulties displayed by many babies who are learning the oral grasp of two similar but different nipples in the earliest learning period for skill acquisition.    Mother was encouraged to call for assistance as desired, and to call with any questions or concerns.    [**NAME**], RN BSN IBCLC Lactation Consultant",3

Problem: Interrupted/Ineffective Breastfeeding Goal: Increase colostrum/breastmilk supply Mother shown how to do breast massage and hand expression of colostrum. Encouragement offered to do this often and then to follow with pumping. Hand expression yielded small amount colostrum more from the left breast than the right.,3
"The pt was sitting up in the rocking chair and the baby was crying and flailing at her breast. I offered assistance and while trying to calm the baby by using my gloved finger to apply oral stimulation the baby began biting down hard on it. The pt verbalized that the baby has been biting on her breast as well. I observed a posterior frenulum that prevents the baby from extending her tongue to her gum line. The mother continued to try to latch the baby. I helped her express 5 ml's of BM from her left breast and spoon fed the baby without difficulty. She settled and returned to sleep STS on the mothers chest. I notified [**NAME**] in the NBN about the need for the Pediatricians assessment and possible frenotomy. I talked to the mother about the use of a nipple shield in the meantime but she was distracted by the baby's movements and trying to support her while sitting up. Continue to offer support and assistance with baby s latch and positioning. [**NAME**] BSN, CLC",1
"Assessment: Pt feels breastfeeding is going better than on the first day.  Expresses concern re: not knowing if she should pump or not. Infant using 20 mm nipple shield to assist with latch due to pt having flatter nipples, per pt. LC on first dol noted uncoridinated suck as well. Infant at 91.6% of birth weight this morning, currently infant is feeding on right breast in cross cradle position with nipple shield in place. Mother states infant feeding hurts sometimes, and other times is very comfortable. Both parents report they have been able to hear infant swallowing while feeding. Voiding and stooling as expected.  Breasts are soft, round, no identified risk factors for decreased milk supply.  Nipples are intact, everted, short, elastic areola easily gathered.  Pt taught how to hand express her breasts, and large drops of colostrum noted bilaterally.   Intervention: Infant unlatched, drops of colostrum present in shield, infant extending tongue well, no evidence of restriction. Infant suck on gloved finger reveals clamping of jaws at initial latch, and intermittent chomping with no relation to suck bursts. Occassional posterior humping of tongue. With permission, infant re-latched to right bare breast, able to latch and suck in bursts with visible/audible swallowing occasionally. Difficult to assess due to infant biting down and frequently pushing off of breat, turning head away. Repositioned to right breast in biological nurturing position, with same result - after several attempts did feed for approximately 5 minutes in bursts. Continued to fuss and arch/flex torso, offered burp, swaddled and re-latched in biologic position - able to feed more calmly for several minutes with audible swallowing. Started crying again, offered burp, then to left breast in modified clutch hold with infant ""sitting up"" to nurse, continuing to bite down intermittently - applied nipple shield with infant latching well. Showed parents how to identify swallowing. Nursed for several minutes before falling asleep. Colostrum visible in shield.  Discussed importance of asymmetrical, chin-led latch, as well as allowing infant to determine feeding times by observing infant for feeding cues.  Instructed to allow infant to finish on one breast, using breast compressions to maximize feeding time before switching to second breast at each feeding.  Reviewed nipple care, typical cluster feeding behavior, infant stomach capacity and expected output for infant.  Also discussed managing possible milk oversupply during milk onset. Discouraged use of pacifiers until breastfeeding is well-established, around 3-4 weeks of age. Encouraged maximizing skin to skin time with infant over the next several days as well.   We discussed adding some pumping/hand expression after feeds to collect small amounts of expressed breast milk to offer infant via spoon when too fussy/hungry to calm and latch to breast, and as a supplement after feeding session - parents open to this, and have already been doing this the last 24 hours. Also encouraged to be vigilant for very early hunger signs to make initial latch easier.  Peds team entered room for evaluation of infant at this time - aware of infant weight loss, plan to discharge home today with f/u Monday. Made them aware of concerns with infant suck behavior, and reassured mother's milk supply adequate.  Pt has a copy of the [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] Breastfeeding book and made aware of resources available to her after discharge. Strongly encouraged parents to schedule appt with outpatient LC - state they have a Monday morning appt with [**NAME**] [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] Peds, counseled to call Monday morning and request breastfeeding appt as well to assess infant latch, expected onset of lactogenesis 2 , use of nipple shield, infant suck.

"Lactation Note: mom states that the baby breast fed for 15 minutes on the left breast but the baby had difficulty breast on the right breast because the nipple is inverted. Upon my assessment the right nipple is not inverted and I was able to latch the baby onto the left breast after massaging the breast and teaching how to do hand expression. The baby stayed on the right breast 15 minutes. Mom did a lot of skin to skin and reports she wants to go to sleep now. I swaddled the baby and gave the baby to grandma. Mom instructed to breast feed on demand and allow the baby to stay on the breast until he is not doing any nutritive sucking. Grandma requested a pacifier and I made her aware of the risk of using a pacifier and she insisted that the FOB wants the baby to have a pacifier. In the meantime the FOB was sleeping and the MOB kept quiet. Upon my assessment of the baby's mouth the baby does have tight frenulum;however, the baby was able to maintain a good latch.

"I was referred to this patient that delivered a newborn yesterday. Ms. [**NAME**] did not receive any prenatal care and delivered the infant at a hunting camp in Cross City. Yesterday she told the medical team in front of her current boyfriend that she was a surrogate and that the infant was not her biological child. She then told staff today she made up the story as she did not want her boyfriend to know the truth. She told the medical staff today she planned to give the infant to her sister in law at bedside. She did not convey this information to me. I met with Ms. [**NAME**] and her sister in law at bedside. She explained the baby was a result of a drunken one night stand and that she did not know how far along she was as she thought the baby would be delivered in February. She did not indicate any plans to give the infant to her sister in law.   She has been dating her boyfriend named [**NAME**] for the past year. They live in [**LOCATION_CITY**] with her two children ages 1 and 2. She stated they have a 2 bedroom home and that Mr. [**NAME**] works at TB Landmark laying pipe. She is a stay at home mother. She expressed she does not receive Medicaid as the case was closed and does not have WIC. She voiced the other children are followed by [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] Pediatrics in [**LOCATION_CITY**]. When exploring her lack of prenatal care she voiced she didn't get around to it as she was moving. She voiced initially there has never been a history of drug use of child protective services involvement. She later stated that DCF was involved as she tested positive for drugs at her last child's birth, but cannot remember what drugs. Per chart screening she tested positive for crystal meth at her last delivery in [**DATE**] and stated it was a one time use. She was not drug tested this delivery.   Ms. [**NAME**] described adequate preparation for the infant's care. She is breast feeding and planned to change to bottle feedings. She stated plans to use broth control pills. She voiced the father of her other two children was abusive and is not involved or supportive. Mr. [**NAME**] and her other two children are currently at the [**LOCATION_OTHER**] Hunting Camp at [**LOCATION_STREET**] in Cross City with plans to stay there through this week.  I explained the plan to contact the Florida Abuse Hotline based on the concerns of a lack of prenatal care and prior drug use. I am also concerned about the various reports of plans for this infant and Ms. [**NAME**] did not indicate to me a plan to give the infant to her sister in law.

Birth weight: 2255g (4lb 15.5oz).  Gestational age by dates: 36w4d.  GA by exam: AGA.  Per chart, mother's obstetric care was terminated at her practice due to missed appointments and missed lab work; when mother called to come in to be checked, she was advised not to come in.  Two accounts of the baby's birth are in chart: 1) the baby was born at home in bed, or 2) the baby was born at home, falling 12 inches to the floor.  Baby is receiving supplemental feeds of bottled formula re: glucose protocol, though mother reports baby ""throws up"" the formula, then has had some difficulty with latching.  Mother states that although her baby is awakening, her nurse has advised not to feed the baby until the next blood sugar test.    Lactation history:  Mother reports she nursed her last child for two months, ""but then I just dried up.""  Mother reports giving formula to her baby after many breastfeeds prior to the weaning, ""becauses I didn't have enough milk - - he was always hungry.""    Patient teaching:  Mother was asked if she would like a breastpump to express her milk for any supplemental feeds, and the mother stated, ""Yes.""  A medical-grade electric breastpump was brought to the mother's room, and a demonstration was provided to the mother in regard to assembly, dissembly, and washing of pump parts.  Mother also stated that she was familiar with this breastpump due to having pumped previously for a baby in NICU.  A pumping log was provided to the mother with a review of volume expectations re: drops or no drops today.  Mother was encouraged to pump at least 8 to 10 times daily in order to provide adequate breast stimulation for any missed feeding at the breast.  Mother was given [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**]'s breastfeeding handbook, and we reviewed common ages for baby's upcoming growth spurts.  We discussed the temporary nature of breast engorgement, and this content was also shown to mother from the breastfeeding handbook.
