This social worker met MOB during a prior admission.   MOB with history of domestic violence (DV) with FOB (Thomas), however they no longer reside together.  She reports currently residing in a safe and stable home environment with her mother and sister who are involved and supportive.  MOB reports FOB was present at delivery and is expected to be present prior to this discharge.  She reports feeling safe in the hospital setting and is aware to call out for assistance if needed.  MOB appeared to minimize her risk or infant risk having FOB present for a visit.  She reports she has not seen him since April, which was the last incident of a string of DV assaults.  A review of medical records reveals MOB disclosed to social work she previously lost custody of her older child due to exposing him to DV.  MOB reports she does not plan to have FOB involved in newborn's life, but then stated that if he was involved it would be only with her supervision.  MOB reports FOB lives far away from her home, and feels he does not pose a threat.  MOB reports no plans for FOB to sign birth certificate, as it would grant him legal rights to newborn.  MOB reports feeling safe at home with her family, who are aware of her history with FOB and do not approve of his involvement.",0

"Social work met with MOB following a routine chart screening due to multiple social concerns, including history of domestic violence with FOB, 2 inpatient admissions due to suicidal gestures, and undocumented custody of 1 child.      A review of PNC records indicate MOB has a restraining order against her spouse, [**NAME**], during this pregnancy for physical violence.   When social work initially met with MOB she was accompanied bedside by her spouse, [**NAME**].  Social work did not elicit information re: domestic violence (DV) due to concerns for patient and newborn safety.  However, they did report residing together in a home they have lived in for one week, and that spouse was involved and supportive.  They were not able to provide a physical address for where they are residing.    MOB reports her ""aunt"" is in the process of adopting her 2y/o child and denies any involvement with DCF.  She reports she was ""too young"" to care for a child, but was unable to provide any other information.    MOB reports a current stable mood and denies history of post partum depression.    Social work later met with MOB and her grandmother, [**NAME**], while FOB briefly left the room.  Social work confirmed that MOB does still have a restraining order in place against FOB.  Social work provided anticipatory guidance to DCF involvement and MOB appeared to understand the reason for their involvement.  Her grandmother appeared very supportive of helping MOB develop and alternate, and safer discharge plan than residing with FOB.    Due to concerns regarding a safe discharge of newborn, a report was made to and accepted by FL Abuse Hotline ([**CONTACT_PHONE**]-ABUSE) reporter Christen ID#[**ID**] with an immediate response indicated.  [**LOCATION_CITY**] County DCF protective investigator [**NAME**] ([**CONTACT_PHONE**]) initiated investigation bedside and was accompanied by UPD and security.  UPD determined FOB, [**NAME**] Fox was in violation of a restraining order that MOB placed approximately one month ago, and he was ultimately arrested without incident.    After an extensive interview with MOB and her grandmother, [**NAME**], it was determined that DCF will not request to shelter newborn, but instead will place services in the home.  MOB has agreed to reside on the property of her grandmother, and will not allow FOB to visit.  She has agreed to a psychiatric and substance abuse assessment at Meridian and in-home parenting support and education with The Nurturing Program.  She has also been referred to Healthy Start.  DCF plans to meet with FOB at the [**LOCATION_CITY**] County Jail to update him and let him know the plan.

Disposition: stable  Operative Report and Findings: The patient was taken to the operating room and there under epidural anesthesia her abdomen was draped and prepped in the usual sterile fashion.  A pfannenstiel incision was made and the various anatomical layers were dissected down to the layer of the parietal peritoneum.The parietal peritoneum was entered with aid of hemostats and Metzenbaum scissors. A bladder flap was established with aid of Metzenbaum scissors.  A transverse incision was made on the lower uterine segment and spread with blunt finger dissection.  A viable male infant was delivered bulb suctioned  after it behaved vigorously and handed to the NICU unit on standby.  The patient had a nuchal cord x 2 that was reduced.

MOB shared has mostly worked through the grief of this loss, but still feels sad at times, including his birthday and the date of his death. I validated this emotional response and provided brief supportive counseling. We also discussed increased risk for PPD given this loss and the stress of her baby's condition and hospitalization. I encouraged follow up with her OB/GYN as needed should symptoms arise. MOB is also enrolled in Healthy Start and has counseling resources available through this program.  MOB has very limited support at this time. She advised that all of her family in [**LOCATION_CITY**] are busy with work and their own children. MOB also noted that she and [**NAME**], are not in a relationship at this time, although she does anticipate he will be involved to some extent in baby's life. It is unlikely that FOB will be able to come sign birth certificate, but MOB stated that she would like him to be on it and that she also intends to pursue child support. I provided guidance for requesting birth certificate amendment.   MOB received limited prenatal care due to transportation issues. We discussed the importance of resolving transportation barriers so that baby can be seen at all recommended medical appointments. I provided information re: Medicaid transportation for this. MOB also reported a plan to obtain a vehicle upon receipt of her income tax return.   MOB resides with her three children and the family is supported by income from MOB's job, child support and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. MOB is enrolled in Healthy Start and is planning to breast feed. I discussed breastfeeding meal voucher program and will provide vouchers upon her d/c. I also provided information re: SSI. MOB had questions re: her baby's condition and whether ""he'll be disabled"". I provided general information re: criteria for SSI and encouraged MOB to discuss specific medical questions with the medical team.  I will continue to follow with the team.  [**NAME**], LCSW",1

"This note was copied from the chart of BOY/[**NAME**]. Lactation:  Consult per RN and mother's request for newborn with anterior vs. complete cleft lip on the L (unilateral) [please see pediatric assessment on [**DATE**]].  Mother is [**NAME**], a 25 y/o G1P1001 with negative and confirmed serologies, who was GBS+ and treated with ampicillin x 4.  Mother gave birth to her son on [**DATE**] at 12:35pm via spontaneous vaginal delivery.  GA by dates: 39w2d.  GA by exam: pending weeks, AGA by weight.  Birth weight: 3039g.  APGARS [**DATE**].     The mother's room was filled with happy extended family members who soon departed for the consult.  FOB was present for the consultation.   Mother reported that she experienced some biting during baby's earlier feed.   Mother plans to be a stay-at-home mother for an indefinite period of time.   Maternal breast assessment:  Breasts are medium to medium-large in size, closely spaced, and symmetrical with moderate density.  Nipple anatomy is well-defined and well-protracted, nonreddened and intact.    Infant assessment for feeding readiness:  Baby was awake and alert, licking lips and opening mouth.    Feeding assessment:  Mother was assisted in positioning her baby on the left breast in cross-cradle and cradle holds.  Baby displayed some brief initial on-and-off behavior on this first breast for less than one minute, and a 24mm nipple shield was provided to support the baby's ability to latch, although baby did not latch with the nipple shield.  Baby was returned to the breast without a nipple shield, then was soon able to sustain the latch with appropriately rhythmic suckling x 10 minutes.  The L breast was palpably softer after the feed.   Following a short 2-minute nap by the baby, the mother was assisted in positioning her baby in the cross-cradle hold and cradle hold on the right breast.  Baby latched quickly onto the second breast (the right), and the baby nursed for another 6 minutes into a deeply relaxed state re: complete hand and arm extension with limpness.  The mother's left breast was palpably softer than the right (the baby had nursed longer on the first breast, which was the left breast).  Baby displayed appropriate jaw excursions during the feed at both breasts, and there was frequent audible swallowing heard while baby nursed from each breast.    Patient teaching:  Mother was advised to offer the breast to her baby at least 8 to 12 times every 24 hours, in response to baby's early hunger cues of licking lips, hand-to-mouth, and rooting behavior.  The [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] breastfeeding handbook was provided, and we reviewed baby's reported one urine and one stool thus far as having met Day 1's goals for output per the handbook's feeding-and-diaper-change chart.  Mother was commended for baby's beautiful feeding, and the baby's father expressed his happiness in regard to how well his son had nursed.  Mother was encouraged to call for assistance as desired, and to call with any questions or concerns.  [**NAME**], RN BSN IBCLC Lactation Consultant",1
"This note was copied from the chart of BOY/[**NAME**]. Lactation:  Follow-up consult by parents' request for fussy baby not latching.  Baby had been sleepy today following circumcision, although mother reports one brief 4-minute feed as well as one 40-minute feed post-circumcision.    Maternal breast assessment:  Breasts are medium to large in size, closely spaced, heavy, and asymmetrical re: L breast distinctly smaller than the right.  Mother reports that baby's recent 40-minute feeding took place on this now-smaller breast.    Feeding assessment:  After placing the baby in skin-to-skin contact with the mother, the mother was assisted in positioning her baby in football hold on the right breast, although only minimal guidance was needed by the mother for positioning her baby to feed.  Mother was then assisted in helping her baby with latch, and baby was able to sustain the latch after a few unsuccessful attempts, then displayed rhythmic suckling with audible swallows.  Baby nursed for 10+ minutes into a deeply relaxed state re: limp arms and deep sleep. Baby did not require the support of any nipple shield during this feed.    Patient teaching:  Light breast compression was discussed with the mother in order to help baby sustain the latch more quickly, and we also discussed the frequent loss of latch and difficulty with latch following the use of an artificial nipple, and particularly the early use of an artificial nipple.  Parents acknowledged that baby has used a pacifier, and the grandmother was holding a pacifier attached to a soft toy animal.  We discussed the frequent skill decay for breastfeeding re: difficulty with latch following the use of an artificial nipple, particularly during a baby's skill acquisition for latch, since babies learn to correlate the smell, touch, and taste of the maternal nipple with suckling and the receipt of milk, versus learning to correlate the smell, touch, and taste of an artificial nipple with suckling.  Parents and grandmother were open to this discussion in a highly positive manner.    Mother was encouraged to offer baby the breast in early hunger, when latch is easier to learn.  Mother was further encouraged to call for assistance as desired, and to call with any questions or concerns.  [**NAME**], RN BSN IBCLC Lactation Consultant",1

"Lactation:  Consult by RN request for maternal complaints of bleeding nipples, although RN states that she did not observe any bleeding upon exam.    Mother states that she does not have nipple pain when baby latches, ""but then it starts hurting when she starts sliding down on it.""    Lactation history:  Mother states she did not breastfeed her first child, who is now 2 years old:  ""I didn't even think about it.""    Maternal breast exam:  Breasts are medium in size, closely spaced, rounded and symmetrical.  Both nipples have transverse compression bruises/stripes along the tips, but are otherwise nonreddened and intact.    Infant assessment for feeding readiness:  Infant is in a deep sleep on mother's chest.  Mother declined to wake baby for feeding in order to practice improved technique, preferring to wait until baby wakens independently.    Patient teaching:  Discussed bringing baby in closer to the breast (chin on breast, cheeks touching breast) in response to pain at any point in the feeding.  If this slight re-positioning does not resolve the nipple pain, mother was advised to interrupt baby's latch when pain continues by safely releasing baby from the breast in order to avoid further nipple trauma.  Baby can then be relatched, and almost always, babies open wider for a relatch.  Babies frequently end the feed by releasing the latch, while at other times babies slide down on the tip of the nipple, pulling the nipple as they learn how to come off the breast.  Releasing baby's latch was again recommended to the mother in order to protect her nipple integrity.  Mother has the Medela TenderCare lanolin product and was encouraged to use this after nursing, and to otherwise let pain be her guide and relatch baby as needed.    In response to mother's earlier request to her nurse for bottles and/or pump, extensive teaching was provided on the nature of the frequent breastfeeding difficulties displayed by many babies who are learning the oral grasp of two similar but different nipples in the earliest learning period for skill acquisition.    Mother was encouraged to call for assistance as desired, and to call with any questions or concerns.    [**NAME**], RN BSN IBCLC Lactation Consultant",3

Liveborn infant male weighing 2920 grams with Apgars of 8 and 9.  Indication: [**NAME**] is a 36 y.o. female para 0010 who was being induced for pre-eclampsia at term.  She progressed on pitocin to [**DATE**].  She did not progress further after 2 hours of adequate contractions.  Decision was made to proceed with cesarean delivery.   Procedure: After satisfactory anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped in a routine fashion for abdominal surgery. Time-out confirmed patient and procedure. The abdomen was entered with a Pfannensteil approach. The rectus muscles were separated in the midline and the peritoneum was entered with sharp dissection while maintaining visualization of the bowel and bladder.  The superior aspect of the fascial incision was grasped upward and the underlying rectus muscle was dissected away with a combination of sharp and blunt dissection.   Attention was then turned to the inferior aspect which was grasped upward and underlying rectus muscles were dissected away with sharp dissection.   A bladder flap was made.  A low transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and extended laterally.  Amniotic fluid was clear. The above described infant was delivered from the cephalic presentation. The cord was clamped and the cord was cut and the baby handed to the pediatrician who was present for delivery. Blood for gases and DNA was obtained. The placenta was delivered by manual extraction.   The uterus was cleared of clots and debris. The uterus was exteriorized. The uterus was closed with a two layer closure; initial layer was a 0-monocryl locking layer; the second layer was an imbricating layer of 0-monocryl.  The uterus was replaced into the patient's abdomen. The hysterotomy was hemostatic as was the fascia and rectus muscles.   The fascia was closed with 0-Vicryl starting at the angle and running in a continuous fashion. The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated with normal saline and was found to be hemostatic.  The subcutaneous tissue was reapproximated with 3-0 vicryl.  The skin was closed with with 0-monocryl. Dermabond was applied. The vagina was cleared of clots.

Upon arrival to L&D she had multiple severe range blood pressures which required IV treatment. She was started on magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis, and decision was made to proceed with induction of labor for CHTN with superimposed preeclampsia. Patient desired a vaginal birth after cesarean, so she was counseled appropriately consented, and started with a foley bulb induction of labor given initial cervical exam closed/thick/high. During induction, patient was examined and fetal position had changed to breech. Decision was made to take patient to operating room for repeat cesarean given fetal malpresentation.   DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfannenstiel incision. The incision was taken down to the level of the fascia which was incised in the midline. The incision was extended laterally in either direction over the rectus muscles. The fascia was dissected off the rectus muscle superiorly and then inferiorly. The rectus muscle was divided sharply with a scalpel. The peritoneum was entered sharply in a clear space sharply with Metzenbaum scissors. A bladder flap was created and the bladder blade was repositioned. A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with the surgeon's fingers. The amniotic fluid was clear upon rupture.  The above described infant was delivered from the Breech presentation.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood was obtained for analysis.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.  The uterus was exteriorized, and the uterine incision was closed in two layers, the first a running suture of 0 Monocryl and the second a running, imbricating suture of 0 Monocryl. Two figure of eight stitches of 3-0 vicryl were placed along uterine incision for additional hemostasis.    The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity.  Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision, posterior to the bladder, and in the subfascial area.  The fascia was closed with two sutures of 0 Vicryl beginning from either end of the incision and meeting in the midportion.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and closed with a running suture of 3-0 chromic.  The skin was closed with a running subcuticular closure of 3-0 Monocryl.   Dermabond was applied to the incision.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.   [**NAME**], MD",0

DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.

"This note was copied from the chart of BOY/[**NAME**]. Lactation:  Consult by RN request for this preterm infant's first breastfeeding practice session today.  Mother has been using a medical-grade electric breastpump in her patient room, and reports that she obtained drops in the bottom of the pump bottle from her most recent pumping today.     Maternal breast assessment:  Breasts are medium in size, closely spaced, pendulous and soft. There is a high level of elasticity in the areolae.  Nipple anatomy is well-defined and protractile.    Infant assessment for feeding readiness:  Infant was asleep beside the mother's breast upon my arrival, although RN reported baby had been displaying hand-to-mouth behavior several minutes prior.  Within five minutes of my arrival, baby stirred and displayed hunger cues re: rooting behavior and hand-to-mouth behavior.    Feeding assessment:  Mother was assisted in positioning her baby in the cross-cradle hold at the right breast.  Baby slept at the breast for five minutes, then roused, and mother was assisted in guiding baby in to the breast for the oral grasp/latch.  Baby was on-and-off the breast in a common early learning display, prior to learning how to achieve the oral grasp at the breast.  In less than 5 minutes, baby was able to sustain the latch and displayed appropriate rhythmic suckling with appropriate sucking bursts.  Baby nursed for approximately 30 minutes on the right breast, with occasional loss of latch every 5 to 10 minutes, then was assisted in successful re-latching.  After 30 minutes on the right breast, baby was assisted with positioning and latch in the football/clutch hold at the L breast.  Baby latched quickly on the second breast and nursed in an appropriate rhythmic manner, losing the latch only twice, and relatching without assistance on the second loss of the latch.  Baby nursed for another 15 minutes, then entered a state of deep relaxation and sleep, with the outer arm and fingers extended and limp.    Patient teaching:  Mother was advised to continue to express her milk after nursing, for at least 8 pumpings every 24 hours toward a full daily volume of 800ml that will likely be achieved by Day 14 or very soon thereafter.  In spite of this baby's early breastfeeding skill that was displayed today, preterm infants have less buccal fat pad tissue than term infants, and may not transfer adequate volumes from the breast until another pound of weight is gained, for example. (The newborn's buccal fat pads must contain adequate amounts of fat in order to babies to create enough vacuum pressure [""suction""] for adequate milk transfer.  Building and maintaining a full volume of 800ml of expressed milk daily is a standard recommendation to mothers of NICU babies, until the infant can exclusively breastfeed and gain weight well.  This pumping regimen is considered protective of the mother's milk supply, until the preterm infant displays the consistent ability to transfer adequate volumes of milk.  In this manner, the preterm infant is also protected by an abundant maternal milk supply.    Parents are to obtain a fax number for sending a prescription to their insurance company for a medical-grade electric breastpump.  The medical prescription has already been provided today to the parents via RN and nurse practitioner. Parents have also been given the contact information for local resources regarding a pump rental.  Even though the mother has already been provided with a high-end retail breastpump (Medela Pump In Style) by her insurance company, a medical-grade/hospital-grade electric breastpump is the standard of care for building full volume when there is daily separation between mother and baby, as in hospitalization.     At 1:45pm today, mother was able to express 3ml from the medical-grade electric breastpump in her patient room, and this was celebrated.  I had advised the mother earlier today to practice increasing the vaccum pressure [""suction""] as high as she could comfortably tolerate with the pump, and both parents were delighted with this marked increase in volume.

Procedure: After satisfactory anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped in a routine fashion for abdominal surgery. Time-out confirmed patient and procedure. The abdomen was entered with a Pfannensteil approach.  The superior aspect of the fascial incision was grasped upward and the underlying rectus muscle was dissected away with a combination of sharp and blunt dissection.  Attention was then turned to the inferior aspect which was grasped upward and underlying rectus muscles were dissected away with sharp dissection.  The rectus muscles were separated in the midline and the peritoneum was entered with blunt dissection while maintaining visualization of the bowel and bladder.  A bladder flap was made.  A low transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and extended laterally.  Amniotic fluid was clear. The above described infant was delivered from the cephalic presentation. The cord was clamped and the cord was cut and the baby handed to the pediatrician who was present for delivery. Blood for gases and DNA was obtained. The placenta was delivered with cord traction.   The uterus was cleared of clots and debris. The uterus was exteriorized. The uterus was closed with a two layer closure; initial layer was a 0-vicryl locking layer; the second layer was an imbricating layer of 0-vicryl.  The uterus was replaced into the patient's abdomen. The hysterotomy was hemostatic as was the fascia and rectus muscles.  The fascia was closed with 0-Vicryl starting at the angle and running in a continuous fashion. The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated with normal saline and was found to be hemostatic. The subcutaneous tissue was reapproximated with 3-0 vicryl.  The skin was closed with with 0-monocryl.

"This note was copied from the chart of BOY/[**NAME**]. Lactation:  Two visits were provided today, with patient teaching on early to advanced hunger cues and offering baby the breast during early hunger, for easiest learning by baby.  Mother states baby can latch and nurse on the right breast, and RN reports baby has nursed independently on the right, but the mother states, ""He comes off in a few minutes and cries.""  The mother stated her perception that baby is still hungry, and we discussed again offering the same breast and/or offering the other breast, and continuing to go back and forth between breasts until baby is full, with the rationale of multiple milk releases from the breast.  Female visitors were present during my second visit, and one of the visitors was holding baby in one arm and a bottle of formula in the other hand.    Mother denied nipple soreness or nipple pain with breastfeeding thus far.  We discussed the common learning behavior in newborns that follows the use of an artificial nipple, and particularly the early use of an artificial nipple re: difficulty with latch and/or sucking at the breast.  Mother was encouraged to offer baby the breast in response to baby's early hunger cues, and to request any needed assistance from the nursing staff as well as the breastfeeding specialists, until baby is nursing well for all feeds as the mother wishes.    Mother was provided with a pump kit at her request and at the request of the nursing staff, and a pump demonstration of the manual pump was also provided.  The baby is reported to now be nursing well on one breast, and mother was reassured that many babies learn how to latch onto one breast a day or more before learning how to latch onto the other breast.    [**NAME**], RN BSN IBCLC Lactation Consultant",3
"Lactation F/U note: I returned to see this pt per her request to assist with latching and positioning. The baby was STS and readily latched on with the cross cradle position and some finger stimulation. A wide open mouth was obtained with the nipple to nose technique and baby was brought close and latched immediately. Deep sucks and rhythmic jaw movements were noted and milk transfer was observed and the pt stated she could feel the deep sucking but denied any pain or burning. I commended her technique and the successful latch which was obtained without the aide of the nipple shield. The pt was encouraged to continue feeding the baby and to stimulate him intermittently if he falls asleep with physical touch and breast compressions. Continue to support and assist as needed.

"Please see previous SW notes for continuity.  SW received referral, re: Husband of MOB ([**NAME**]) stating ""there is a man in my wife's room and I think he is going to steal my baby.""  SW first met with MOB's husband (not the man who was caring for MOB and baby yesterday during SW assessment), who stated that the man who has been in his wife's room taking care of her wants to take away his baby.  SW met with MOB privately. SW asked MOB about the two men. MOB stated that the man ([**NAME**]) who has been helping to care for her and baby is the father of her 8 y/o son, not her husband. MOB stated that her husband works all the time and she needs someone in the room with her to help with her care and baby's care. She stated that [**NAME**] took the entire week off of work to help her. She also stated that she has been living in Jose's house for most of the pregnancy because he is then able to parent their son and help take care of her.  SW asked MOB if she has any concerns that [**NAME**] would try to ""steal"" her baby. MOB stated that is ridiculous. She stated that [**NAME**] is a good father to her son and is a good friend to her. SW explained to MOB that her husband has concerns that [**NAME**] would like to take the baby for his own. MOB stated that there is friction between the two men. She stated that there is a slight possibility that [**NAME**] is the father of the baby, but she does not think so. She asked about paternity tests. SW informed MOB that paternity tests are not done in the hospital, but by outside organizations.   SW suggested to MOB that she may want to tell the two men that they cannot be at the hospital at the same time.  SW met with MOB's husband ([**NAME**]) and informed him that MOB has no concerns about baby's safety around Jose. SW explained to [**NAME**] that the hospital staff cannot remove a visitor that is not considered a safety concern by MOB. SW encouraged [**NAME**] to discuss his concerns with MOB.  SW returned to MOB's room to request some information and MOB stated that she wanted Jean to leave. SW informed [**NAME**] that he needs to leave if MOB is requesting that he leave. SW instructed MOB to contact her nurse if [**NAME**] will not leave as requested.   SW will continue to follow as needed. If there are any safety concerns, please call security.",0

I found the baby to be extremely jittery and difficult to console. I place a gloved finger in her mouth and found that she had difficulty latching and sucking on my finger as well as on the nipple of the bottle. I changed her wet diaper and swaddled her and she became calm and returned to sleep. The pt requested that I return later. When I returned about 30 minutes later the pt was ending her phone call and returned to her bed for my assistance. The baby was placed STS on the mothers left breast. Massage and hand expression were performed with colostrum was expressed from both breasts in large droplets. I encouraged her to pump after breast feeding and to supplement with her breast milk.

"Lactation support and assistance: The pt had her baby resting across her abdomen with his mouth latched only on the nipple portion of a 24 mm nipple shield. I suggested that he be repositioned to improve both her comfort and to obtain a deeper latch. She requested that we try him without the nipple shield. The baby was placed STS on his abdomen tummy to chest with the pt. Her nipple was erect and the baby easily latched on with a deep asymmetric latch. I provided her with education regarding breast massage and hand expression. The pt had several lumps and knots in both breasts which I massaged with warm wash clothes and performed breast compressions while the baby displayed consistent and rhythmic sucking and swallowing. Milk was easily expressed from both breasts between nursing episodes. I encouraged frequent STS with the pt and the FOB. Feeding cues and feeding on demand at least 8-10 times/24hours was strongly reinforced. The [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] Breastfeeding book was provided and all successful lactation details were reviewed. I discussed the football nursing position and the pt verbalized satisfaction with using it. I explained the details of a nutritive latch, baby's daily feeding log, and important outpatient resources. I inquired about nipple pain or discomfort during or after breastfeeding. I provided her with a hospital grade electric pump and demonstrated it's use. The FOB assisted with the pumping process and participated in the cleaning and assembly of the pumping supplies. The pt had approximately 10 ml's of breast milk after about 10 minutes of pumping on the preemie cycle. I demonstrated the use of the hand pump and encouraged her to continue performing breast massage and compressions while nursing and to allow the bay to empty her breasts while nursing him on each side with each nursing session. I also recommended that she pump to completely empty her breasts if the baby is not able to in the beginning of his growth and development. I congratulated them both on the baby's birth and encouraged F/U with a lactation counselor for any further concerns with engorgement or breast feeding.  [**NAME**] RN, BSN, CLC",3

MOB reported support from FOB ([**NAME**]) and MOB's mother and step-father. MOB stated that she and FOB live together with their (now) four children.   MOB reported that she started prenatal care late because she had trouble with Medicaid. She stated that she then went to all of her appointments, except when she was hospitalized for sickle cell crisis.   MOB reported all baby needs met, including car seat, clothing, diapers, wipes, and crib/bassinet. MOB reported that she receives WIC and Food Stamps, but declined referral for Healthy Start.  SW talked with MOB about her history with depression, anxiety, and panic attacks. She stated that most of her issues stem from sickle cell. She stated that the constant pain contributes to her depression. She also stated that she gets anxious about being alone with her children for long periods of time because she is afraid she will have a sickle cell crisis and not be able to get in touch with anyone for help. She stated that her most recent panic attack was when FOB left the home and accidentally took her phone with him. She stated that she started having pain and then could not call anyone for help. SW acknowledged these fears and concerns. SW encouraged MOB to seek counseling to help her manage these worries. MOB stated that her grandmother is her ""counselor."" SW encouraged this relationship, but also suggested that it is often good to have someone other than a family member as a counselor. MOB declined counseling with Healthy Start.   SW educated MOB about SIDS, Back to Sleep, and Shaken Baby Syndrome. SW also talked with MOB at length about her risk for post-partum depression and again encouraged her to seek help with a doctor or counselor if she notices signs or symptoms.   SW has no other concerns at this time.",0

"This note was copied from the chart of BABY/[**NAME**]. Lactation:  Follow-up consult for maternal nipple pain with feeds.  Although baby underwent frenotomy yesterday, baby has a high palate, which is a risk factor for nipple pain and nipple damage due to the nipple being moved higher with each suck, and mother's nipples are fairly short, which is another risk factor for nipple pain and nipple damage.  The shorter the maternal nipple, the greater the risk for the nipple to be in contact with the hard surfaces of the alveolar ridge and hard palate near the front of the baby's mouth, in contrast to the maternal comfort experienced when the nipple reaches the baby's soft palate, termed ""the comfort zone"" for the mother's comfort.  During yesterday evening's consult, mother's nipple was visibly creased/pinched in spite of baby's deep latch with wide gape well onto the areola.    This morning mother reports difficult feedings overnight with unsuccessful attempts by nursing staff when baby was crying near the breast, as compared to yesterday evening's lactation consultation when baby was brought to the breast in a calm state.  When babies are actively crying, the tongue is elevated with each cry, and the mother's nipple cannot then reach the superior aspect of the baby's tongue.  A helpful analogy is the impossible task of trying to drink out of a straw when placing the straw under the tongue, instead of correctly placing the straw above the tongue.  Today the mother reports she has decided to temporarily express her milk and give baby her bottled milk, due to painful feedings at the breast and baby's difficulty with the oral grasp at the breast.  Today baby's I & O sheet reflects adequate stooling and very high urine output, and the parents were given extensive teaching on monitoring baby's feedings and output by using the tracking sheet in [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**]'s breastfeeding handbook.    Mother was commended for her current volume of expressed milk, which is higher than average for baby's age (baby will reach 48 hours of age at 7:43pm today).  Mother was provided with a pumping log, and her two pumpings were recorded on this log in order for mother to assess her higher than average volume of expressed milk so soon after the birth.  Mother reports she expressed 8ml with the first of her daily pumpings today, and she expressed 15ml with second pumping this morning.  Today's goal for Day 3 postpartum is a daily total of 30 to 75ml from at least 8 pumpings, so mother's expressed milk thus far today at a total of 23ml from her two morning pumpings has impressively approached the low normal range of 30ml from at least 8 pumpings, and thus mother was highly commended for her milk production.    Evidence of Lactogenesis II in this mother is present re: the increase in volume over colostrum alone, and mother was advised to expect a full milk supply of 25 to 35 ounces daily by expressing her milk at least 8 times daily, including at least two nighttime pumpings, and this volume is typically achieved with such pumping frequency within 7 to 14 days after the birth.  Similarly, newborns need to feed at least 8 to 12 times every 24 hours in order to gain weight appropriately.   Parents report they will be taking baby for his first pediatrician's visit on Monday, [**DATE**].  We reviewed the contact information for infant nutrition resources listed in [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**]'s breastfeeding handbook, and mother was warmly invited, along with her baby, to [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**]' breastfeeding mothers support group on Tuesdays.  Mother was encouraged to call for assistance as needed/as desired, and to call with any questions or concerns.  [**NAME**], RN BSN IBCLC Lactation Consultant",3

EKG ([**DATE**]): Sinus tachycardia     Hospital Course: 22 y.o. para2102 @ 23w2d with a twin gestation with one viable baby and one complete mole. She had been managed inpatient and treated medically for sequelae of her mole including hyperthyroid, with PTU, and hypertension. The day of delivery her blood pressures had acutely risen and her dose of labetalol had been increased from 400 BID to 600 TID. She called out that night with acute abdominal pain and bright red bleeding. She had a known clot near her cervix but this red blood and pain were concerning for new bleeding. She was transported to the OR where additional lines were placed, mag bolus was started, labs were sent and blood products were obtained. During this 30 minutes the fetal heart rate was minimally variable with a baseline in the 160s when it had previously been in the 140s, thus this was concerning for fetal compromise, possibly from abruption, thus we proceeded with delivery.    She was taken to the operating room on [**DATE**] and went on to deliver a Liveborn infant female weighing 570 grams with Apgars of 1, 2, 3 & 5. No cords gases due to cord sweeping. Hemosiderin stained amniotic fluid. Prior to intubation, baby required compressions but after ETT placed and surfactant given, baby responded well and left on 21% O2.   For the full operative information, see the operative note.    She received magnesium for 24 hours PP. Her blood pressures were controlled and on POD#5, her BP medications was discontinued     Her thyroid tests normalized and she was taken off PTU on POD#4.     Patient had a fever on POD#1 associated with shortness of breath and decreased O2 saturation. CXR showed mild pulmonary edema and atelectasis. She was given Lasix 10 mg IV x 1 with improvement of her symptoms and continued diuresis. Incentive spirometer was encouraged. She did not spike another fever.     On POD #6 Ms. Andreka McAffee desired discharge home.  She was ambulating without assistance, voiding on her own, tolerating a regular diet, and her pain was well controlled.  She was discharged home in good condition.    She will need to followup at [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] group in 1 week in HROB and then in 2 weeks with HRGYN. She will need to get weekly BHcg, which have already been ordered, for the next 1 year or until further notice. She received Depo Provera in the hospital and understands the importance of not getting pregnant in the next year while we are monitoring her Bhcg.

The baby's feeding position was ideally aligned, and baby displayed appropriate jaw excursions and appropriately rhythmic suckling.    Mother pointed out the small bottle of transitional milk on her bedside table, stating that she began pumping last night to spoon-feed baby prior to the baby being able to latch during a fussy period, when the dyad received assistance from the night nurse for baby's latch.  The most recent pumping is reported by the mother as an impressive 30ml volume.  Mother reports that baby ""fed off and on all night - - for six hours"", and we discussed the commonly reported ""second night phenomenon"" re: formerly sleepy newborns now waking with a period of much more frequent feeding.

"This note was copied from the chart of GIRL/[**NAME**]. Lactation:  Rounds with MOB for bilateral nipple damage by RN Thetoria's report.  Discussed with the mother that her shorter nipple anatomy is vulnerable to nipple damage, though not a guarantee of nipple damage, due to the shorter nipple coming into greater contact with the baby's alveolar ridge and hard palate, as these hard surfaces are often  damaging to the maternal nipple.  Mother has been provided a USP-lanolin product by her RN, and we discussed the recommendation to pump for 2 to 5 minutes prior to helping baby with latch, so that the nipple has further depth into the tip of the nipple shield for the feeding, with less likelihood of the nipple staying in contact with the alveolar ridge and/or hard palate throughout feedings.   Mother was assisted in positioning her baby in the football hold on the L.  The nipple shield was partially inverted prior to application in order to protract the nipple, and this was effective in protracting the nipple, albeit not with maximum protractility.   Mother was advised to pump for 2 to 5 minutes prior to nursing baby with or without the shield.    For the nursing staff:  Please assess the mother's nipples for any further nipple damage and the healing process, and please assist the dyad with positioning and the baby's oral grasp as needed for effective milk transfer.

"ATTENDING DISCHARGE SUMMARY DOA:  [**DATE**] DOD:  [**DATE**]  HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted early in the morning on [**DATE**] in labor at 39 weeks 2 days.  She progressed steadily in labor under epidural anestheisa, and at 1510, she spontanously delivered a 7 pound 12 ounce baby boy ([**NAME**]).  She sustained a small 2nd degree vaginal laceration and two small periurethral abrasions.  Each of these areas was repaired with 3-) Vicryl. Approximately 3 hours before delivery, ,she developed a fever and was treated presumptively for chorioamnionitis with ampicillin plus gentamicin.  She received one additional dose of each drug postpartum and rapidly became afebrile.  The baby was treated for 48 hours with antibiotics, pending the return of a negative blood culture.  Baby and mother were ready for discharge on the morning of [**DATE**].  DISPOSITION:  1. The patient is discharged to self-care at home. 2. She was given routine postpartum instructions.  She will continue to monitor her temperature for the next 72 hours. 3.She was given a prescription for ibuprofen, 600 mg, #40, refill x 1. 4.

"Lactation:  Consult per mother's request for nipple soreness with initial latch only.   Lactation history:  Mother reports she nursed her two sons for 14 months and 1 year respectively.    Feeding assessment:  I observed baby in mid-feed through the end of the feed in the cradle hold on the right, and baby had an optimal deep latch with wide gape well onto the areola.  When baby finished the feed, the right nipple was nonreddened and intact, although there is an arc along the underside of the nipple from 8 o'clock to 4 o'clock that appears to be a very slight inversion of that portion of the nipple.  The L nipple is also nonreddened and intact, and is also partially inverted but more so than the right, with a similar but deeper arc at the inverted aspect of the L nipple.  Breasts are medium in size, closely spaced, rounded and symmetrical.    Mother had previously been provided with a USP-grade lanolin product for nipple care, and mother was encouraged to apply the lanolin to any sore area of her nipples after each feed.  Mother was advised that one aspect of her nipple soreness may be the pull of the inverted aspects of her nipples while the baby suckles, and another aspect is the discomfort with the initial latch when the mother's nipple is pulled past the hard surfaces of baby's alveolar ridge and hard palate.  This latter aspect of nipple soreness should be fleeting within the first few seconds of the latch, due to the nipple then being pulled to the baby's soft palate with continued suckling.    An additional observable aspect of the mother's transient soreness during the feed occurred when the mother pressed her breast tissue away from baby's nose, citing the need to create more breathing space for baby's nose.  Mother was advised that pulling the breast tissue away from baby's nose was unnecessary due to baby's adequate breathing space, which was pointed out during the feed, and mother was advised that pulling the breast tissue away from baby has the undesired effect of pulling the nipple back toward the front of baby's mouth near the hard surfaces of the baby's alveolar ridge and hard palate, which can be damaging to the maternal nipple.    Mother stated that she does not plan to work outside the home anytime soon.  Mother was advised of the Affordable Care Act's mandate to private health insurance companies to provide insured mothers with a breastpump per birth.  Mother was provided with [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**]'s breastfeeding handbook with a brief review of the two-page feeding & diaper count chart.  Mother was provided with an invitation to [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**]' Breastfeeding Mothers' Support Group on Tuesdays. Mother was encouraged to call for assistance as desired, and to call with any questions or concerns.  [**NAME**], RN BSN IBCLC Lactation Consultant",1

Birth weight: 2255g (4lb 15.5oz).  Gestational age by dates: 36w4d.  GA by exam: AGA.  Per chart, mother's obstetric care was terminated at her practice due to missed appointments and missed lab work; when mother called to come in to be checked, she was advised not to come in.

Mother reports giving formula to her baby after many breastfeeds prior to the weaning, ""becauses I didn't have enough milk - - he was always hungry.""    Patient teaching:  Mother was asked if she would like a breastpump to express her milk for any supplemental feeds, and the mother stated, ""Yes.""  A medical-grade electric breastpump was brought to the mother's room, and a demonstration was provided to the mother in regard to assembly, dissembly, and washing of pump parts.  Mother also stated that she was familiar with this breastpump due to having pumped previously for a baby in NICU.  A pumping log was provided to the mother with a review of volume expectations re: drops or no drops today.  Mother was encouraged to pump at least 8 to 10 times daily in order to provide adequate breast stimulation for any missed feeding at the breast.

"This note was copied from the chart of GIRL/[**NAME**]. Lactation:  Consult by mother's request on day of discharge home.  Mother has severe nipple and areolar damage on the right, and mother reports this began in the operating room when baby latched onto the breast.  Mother is a registered nurse who works in a correctional facility for mentally ill prisoners, and states she has been provided with a high-end retail breastpump by her health insurance company.  Mother reports bringing this breastpump and using it during this hospital stay, but reports pain when pumping, particularly on the right.    Mother has a history of bilateral breast augmentation.    Yesterday lactation nurse [**NAME**] reported that she had changed mother's breast shield on the mother's retail breastpump from a 24mm to a 27mm shield, due to the mother's nipple and areolar damage.    Lactation history:  Mother reports she expressed her milk and exclusively bottle-fed her 5 y/o child for 6 months, following the difficulty of unsuccessful breastfeeding attempts.   Maternal breast assessment:  Breasts are medium to large (with augmentation) on this small mother's frame, rounded, closely spaced and symmetrical.  Nipple anatomy is very large in diameter bilaterally, and the L nipple is partially inverted though protracted at the base, as well as nonreddened and intact.  Nipple anatomy on the right is protracted but short, and reddened with an arc'd bruise at the most distal aspect of the nipple from 12 o'clock to 5 o'clock.   The L areola is nonreddened and intact, although the right areola is severely reddened, more so along the superior aspect of the right areola.  There is a partial thickness Stage III areolar wound at 11 o'clock proximal to the nipple, 1 mm x  2mm in diameter.    Feeding assessment:  Mother was assisted in positioning her baby in cross-cradle and cradle holds on the L side, and baby was unable to latch without the support of a 24mm nipple shield.  With the 24mm nipple shield, baby latched with minimal guidance, then nursed in an appropriately rhythmic manner with appropriate jaw excursions for approximately 10 minutes.  Baby slept briefly, then was assisted in the football hold on the right.  Remarkably, given the extent of the mother's nipple damage, she was able to comfortably tolerate the feeding on the right by using the 24mm nipple shield.    Interventions and patient teaching:  Mother was provided with a medical-grade electric breastpump to give her the superior experience of the medical-grade EBP for her comfort, and mother reported a painless pumping experience using custom 36mm breast shields, versus the 27mm breast shields that she reports receiving yesterday.  Mother was given information on medical-grade electric breastpump rentals as needed.  A USP-grade lanolin product was provided to the mother, and she applied this to the wounded right nipple and areola.  Mother inquired about using the breast shells provided to her yesterday, reporting that she is using one breast shell on the right for her nipple wounds, and is using the breast shell on the L to further protract the partial inversion of that nipple.  As the breast shell attachment for inverted nipples is significantly smaller than the mother's nipple diameter, mother was advised that she may wear the breast shell on the L with the soreness attachment as needed, although that nipple has no visible injuries at present.     We discussed recent (2015) and past studies correlating early nipple shield use with poor infant weight gain and shorter duration of breastfeeding.  We discussed one study that showed an increased transfer of milk from the breast by preterm infants using a nipple shield, in which the mothers of the preterm infants had been previously pumping to build their milk supplies prior to the preterm infants going to the breast.  We discussed another study on nipple shield use in which no correlation was found re: poor infant weight gain or shorter duration of breastfeeding.  I shared my own professional experiences in lactation of seeing more babies with slow/poor weight gain when a mother has not been pumping at all from birth during early nipple shield use, as well as seeing fewer babies who are using a nipple shield with appropriate weight gain whose mothers have never pumped since birth.     Due to the published risks of early nipple shield use, mother was advised to pump after nursing at least 6 times daily until baby shows a pattern of consistent weight gain, then to gradually reduce her pumpings by dropping one pumping every 2 to 3 days, while giving baby unrestricted access to the breast and monitoring baby's I & O re: counting number of daily feeds for at least 8 to 12 feeds daily, and following the feeding diary with the listed expected daily output from [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**]'s breastfeeding handbook.  Mother's RN background was emphasized re: monitoring baby's I & O.   We reviewed the contact information on regional infant nutrition resources from [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**]'s breastfeeding handbook, including lactation consultants [**NAME**] with [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**]'s Center for Breastfeeding and Newborns, and [**NAME**], who is in private practice.  Mother was encouraged to call for assistance as needed, and to call with any questions or concerns.    [**NAME**], RN BSN IBCLC Lactation Consultant",3

"This note was copied from the chart of BOY/Gala Olaciregui. Lactation:  Lengthy feeding assistance by RN request for difficult latch.  Babe is s/p frenotomy.  Feeding challenges during this consult were thus: 1) the mother has very large, heavy and pendulous breasts, 2) the mother's nipple anatomy is larger than average in diameter, short, and with minimal protractility, 3) baby has a recessed chin, and 4) baby is s/p frenotomy with poor suck organization that has improved slightly with much clinical support.  Mother stated early in the consult that she wants very much to breastfeed her baby, emphasizing that she is ""willing to do whatever it takes.""  Mother is employed by [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] as a coder.    Feeding assessment:   Suck training was provided to baby following initial difficulty with latch, and baby's suck showed slow but gradual improvement in organization at the breast via much clinical support re: breast compression toward baby's mouth to stimulate the suck reflex.   Mother was assisted in using a medical-grade electric breastpump to stimulate/further protract her nipples, and this was effective for several minutes in further protracting the nipple tissue, though the nipples soon returned to a shorter length.  Mother was assisted in positioning her baby in football hold and cradle holds, and a rolled up sheet was placed under the breasts to provide enough lift of the nipple toward the baby versus the natural downward slant of the nipple due to very large and pendulous breasts.  Baby was assisted with latch with and without the nipple shield, and baby's lengthiest success was with the 24mm nipple shield, although baby did display less than 5 minutes of suckling behavior on the L breast without the nipple shield, following several minutes of pumping to protract the nipple tissue.  Baby cluster-fed back and forth between the breasts many times, and either saliva or a very small amount of clear colostrum was noted in the tip of the nipple shield over the course of a lengthy consult.  The mother did not release any drops of colostrum during the pumping session, although the L nipple became well-protracted with pumping, but only briefly.  As the cluster-feed progressed when baby was able to latch without the nipple shield, the mother's L nipple had a horizontally creased compression mark after baby nursed for several minutes in the football hold.  The lengthy breastfeeding practice session ended via tube-feeding formula at the breast with tubing inserted into the corner of baby's mouth.  Even with tube-feeding at the breast, suckling was not yet highly organized.    Patient teaching:  Mother was instructed in the use of the medical-grade electric breastpump in order to help her nipples to become more protractile to help baby with latch, and in order to provide her breasts with adequate stimulation due to early nipple shield use.  We discussed several studies, including a 2015 study, that have correlated early nipple shield use with poor infant weight gain and shorter duration of breastfeeding.  We discussed one study that did not find any correlation with early nipple shield use and shorter duration of breastfeeding, as well as another important study that found preterm infants could transfer greater volumes of milk from the breast using a nipple shield, and lesser volumes of milk from the breast without the support of a nipple shield, although the mothers of these preterm infants had been expressing their milk for their preterm infants for some time prior to breastfeeding practice.  Due to the above studies, mother was advised to pump for 15 minutes after any feed in which baby requires the nipple shield for the time being, and mother was given the option to pump prior to feeding in order to protract her nipples, whether or not baby needs the support of the nipple shield to latch and suckle.    For Pediatrics:  Even though mother is recovering from a vaginal birth, an additional day of inpatient infant feeding support will likely be of great benefit to both mother and baby.

Fascia adherent to underlying muscle. No significant intraperitoneal adhesions. Some filmy adhesions present on left upper portion of uterus. Liveborn infant male weighing 3662 grams with Apgars of 9 and 9.  SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY: bilateral portions of fallopian tubes  INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 29 y.o. female para 1102 at 38w4d with history of prior cesarean x 2 presented from clinic for delivery via repeat cesarean due to concerning BPP [**DATE**] which was done when she reported decreased fetal movement. On arrival here she had reactive and reassuring NST.  DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfannenstiel incision. The incision was taken down to the level of the fascia which was incised in the midline. The incision was extended laterally in either direction over the rectus muscles. The fascia was dissected off the rectus muscle superiorly and then inferiorly. The rectus muscle was divided bluntly. The peritoneum was entered in a clear space sharply.  A bladder flap was attempted but due to very thin lower uterine segment could not be easily separated.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with the surgeon's fingers.  The amniotic fluid was clear.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood was obtained for analysis.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.  The uterus was exteriorized, and the uterine incision was closed in 1 layer, a running, locking suture incorporating the serosa. Two additional figure-of-eight sutures were placed in the midline of the hysterotomy for further hemostasis.    The right fallopian tube was identified by the fimbria, double ligated with 0-chromic suture and the intervening segment excised.  The left fallopian tube was identified by the fimbria, double ligated with 0-chromic suture and the intervening segment excised.    The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity.  Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision, posterior to the bladder, and in the subfascial area.  The fascial closure was started at one end and run to the midline. Just after started fascial closure from the opposite end there was a slight welling up of dilute appearing blood that was persistent and concerning for underlying active bleeding.  Therefore, the fascial sutures were removed and the entire abdomen was re-explored for hemostasis. A few small areas of oozing were noted in the torn muscle edges and small vessels underneath the fascia superiorly which were cauterized with the Bovie. The pericolic gutters were cleaned out, the uterine incision was re-examined, site of tubal ligation re-examined and no source of active bleeding identified after irrigation. The fascia was then closed again using 2 sutures running from either end of the incision and meeting in the midportion. There was no continued welling up of blood and it was presumed what was seen earlier was due to run down and possible slight oozing from the muscle edges which were cauterized.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and re-approximated with interrupted sutures of 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with a running subcuticular closure of 3-0 monocryl. Dermabond was applied to the incision.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.

During induction of labor the patient developed an arrest of dilation at 4 cm. The decision was made to proceed with cesarean delivery.   DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfanenstiel incision. The subcutaneous tissue was incised with electrocautery. The fascia was scored with electrocautery. The fascia was dissected from the anterior rectus muscle using electrocautery, curved mayo scissors, and blunt dissection. The rectus muscle was divided at the midline. The peritoneum was entered using Metzenbaum scissor. The peritoneal incision was extended bilaterally with traction.  A bladder flap was not created.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with traction.  The amniotic fluid was clear.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician.

Significant adhesions between the anterior uterus in the upper segment and the anterior abdominal wall.  Liveborn infant male weighing 3742 grams with Apgars of 9 and 9.  Indication: [**NAME**] is a 19 y.o. female para 1031 who presented to L&D triage at 41w3d gestation with decreased FM.  Noted to have reactive NST.  H/O limited prenatal care due to multiple moves during pregnancy, no care since 30 weeks.  Due to late term gestation, complaints of decreased FM, h/o prior c/s x1, and suspected macrosomia (measured 4300g on growth sono in triage) - plans were made for repeat cesarean delivery.  Pt declined BTI and plans depo postpartum.  Procedure: After satisfactory anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped in a routine fashion for abdominal surgery.  Time-out confirmed patient and procedure.  The abdomen was entered with a Pfannenstiel approach and dissected down to the level of the fascia with sharp dissection and cautery. The fascia was scored in the midline and extended laterally with sharp dissection. The anterior leaf of the fascia was grasped upwards and the underlying rectus muscle was dissected with sharp and blunt dissection. This was also performed inferiorly. The rectus muscles were separated in the midline and the peritoneum was entered and the underlying uterus exposed.  On entry into the peritoneal, significant adhesions were noted between the anterior uterus in the upper segment and the anterior abdominal wall.  A small tear in the uterine serosa was made while examining adhesions, which was later repaired.  Fetal position was confirmed.  The lower uterine segement identified and found to be clear of adhesions.  A bladder flap was created.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and extended laterally with blunt dissection.  Amniotic fluid was clear at the time of rupture.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation and gave a spontaneous cry.  The cord was clamped and cut and the baby handed to the pediatrician.  Blood for gases and DNA was obtained then cord blood donation was performed.  The placenta was delivered with cord traction.  The uterus was not able to be exteriorized due to significant adhesions, but was instead left in place and wiped out with a lap.  The uterus was closed in a single running locked layer closure using 0-Monocryl. The area of torn serosa identified during peritoneal entry was repaired with a running stitch of 2-0 Vicryl and found to be hemostatic. The uterine incision was carefully inspected, found to be hemostatic, and uterine tone was adequate. The fascia was inspected superiorly and inferiorly and was found to be intact and hemostatic.  The fascia was closed with 1 suture of 0-Vicryl starting at the angle and running in a continuous fashion to the opposite angle. The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and closed with 4 interrupted sutures of 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with a running subcuticular stitch of 4-0 Monocryl.  Dermabond was applied.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  There were no identified complications.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.   [**NAME**]",0

Liveborn infant female weighing 500 grams with Apgars of 1, 6, and 6.   SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY: Placenta  INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 26 y.o. female P1011 who was transferred from an outside facility for worsening fetal status in the setting of possible heart defect, suspected severe uteroplacental insufficiency with fetal IUGR and oligohydramnios and maternal uncontrolled CHTN and Type 1 DM with renal failure. Upon arrival, fetus was noted to have a Cat 3 FHT and 2/10 biophysical profile score. After extensive counseling with MFM and Neonatology, the patient desired delivery with full neonatal resuscitation if needed. As such, she was taken to the OR for a cesarean section given fetal malpresentation and prior C/S x 1.   DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfannenstiel incision. The incision was taken down to the level of the fascia which was incised in the midline. The incision was extended laterally in either direction over the rectus muscles. The fascia was dissected off the rectus muscle superiorly and then inferiorly. The rectus muscle was divided bluntly. The peritoneum was entered in a clear space sharply.  A bladder flap was not created.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with the surgeon's fingers.  The amniotic fluid was scant but clear.  The above described infant was delivered from the Breech presentation, with immediate delivery of the flexed aftercoming head after the body.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood was obtained for analysis.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.  The uterus was exteriorized, and the uterine incision was closed in 2 layers, the first a running suture of 0-Vicryl and the second a running, imbricating suture of 0-Vicryl. Several figure of eight sutures of 2-0 Vicryl were placed at the site of the hysterotomy for additional hemostasis.    The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity.  Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision, posterior to the bladder, and in the subfascial area.  The fascia was closed with one suture of 0 Vicryl beginning from one end of the incision and running towards the other.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated. The skin was closed with a running subcuticular closure of 3-0 Monocryl.  Dermabond was applied to the incision.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.  [**NAME**], MD  Attending Note: I was present for the entire procedure.

Dr. [**NAME**],ENT team and Dr. [**NAME**],NICU team were present at delivery  Procedure: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room. After satisfactory anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped in a routine fashion for abdominal surgery.  Time-out confirmed patient and procedure.  It was confirmed that she had received her prophylactic antibiotics and that her sequential compression stockings were in place and functioning. The abdomen was entered with a Pfannensteil approach.  The subcutaneous tissue was dissected up to the fascia. The fascia was incised in the midline and  extended bilaterally by the mayo scissors. The rectus muscles were separated from the overlying rectus sheath superiorly and inferiorly. The rectus was then separated in the midline and peritoneum entered carefully. A self retaining retractor was placed. A bladder flap was not created and then an approximately 4cm transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel. The amniotic membrane was separated from the uterine muscle circumferentially, being careful not to disrupt the membrane prematurely.The retainer portion of the hysterotomy stapler (Premium poly CS-Covidien) was introduced initially on the left all the time lifting the tips of the retainer up against the uterine muscle to avoid inadvertently injuring any fetal tissues. The hysterotomy stappler was fired once it was clear the retainer was clear of uterine vessels and fetal tissue. The stappler was then replaced and reloaded with the same procedure performed on maternal right of the hysterotomy. The fetal head was delivered through the hysterotomy into the intact amniotic sac. Once the fetal head was delivered through the hysterotomy, the amniotic sac was ruptured, fluid was clear.  The infant was delivered cephalic up to the level of both arms and Dr [**NAME**] with his ENT team intubated the infant uneventfully. Upon completion, the umbilical cord was clamped and cut,blood for gases and DNA obtained  with baby handed to the waiting pediatricians. .  The placenta was delivered with cord traction.  The uterus was wiped out with a lap.  The uterus was closed in a double layer closure using two layers of 0- vicryl.  The fascia was closed with 1 suture/s of 0-Vicryl starting at the angle and running in a continuous fashion. The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and reapproximated with interrupted sutures of 2-0 chromic.  The skin was closed with 4-0 monocryl.  Dermabond was applied.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.  [**NAME**] MD  I was present for the entire case.  I reviewed the resident's note and made appropriate corrections and additions to it.

Procedure: After satisfactory anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped in a routine fashion for abdominal surgery.  Time out confirmed the patient and procedure.  The abdomen was entered with a transverse incision below the umbilicus.  Stay sutures of 0-Vicryl were placed through the fascia on either side of the incision.  The right fallopian tube was identified by the fimbria and a loop ligated with #1-plain gut suture.  A small defect was made in the mesosalpinx within the loop and each side of the tube double ligated with 0-chromic suture. The intervening segment was excised.  Presence of lumen was confirmed in the excised segment.  Each end of the remaining tube was made hemostatic with cautery.  The exact same procedure was repeated on the left fallopian tube.   The fascia was closed by reapproximating the stay sutures of O-Vicryl.  The skin was closed with a subcuticular stitch of 3-0 monocryl.  Dermabond was applied.

"Lactation Note The pt was sitting up and holding Raediance [twin B] on her chest when I saw her today. The baby was not STS so I provided encouragement and discussed with her the benefits of practicing STS with both of her daughters. She was receptive to the information. She continued to reply with information that had already been discussed with her and she was very confident with her knowledge base. I reviewed her [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] Breast feeding booklet as she wasn't able to remember some of the information from the previous day. She was able to demonstrate breast massage and hand expression. She understands the importance of breast feeding prior to pumping as she wants to pump to build her milk supply. RaeLynn [twin A] was asleep in the crib and the pt states she gave her formula about two hours prior to my visit because she was still crying after nursing and the pt was concerned about her supply. The pt states that she has concerns R/T a possible tongue in RaeLynn and wants to speak to the pediatrician about it tomorrow.I reinforced the supply and demand process of milk production and encouraged her to allow the baby to nurse unrestricted until she is satisfied. The pt revealed difficulty with obtaining a breast pump from WIC and states she intends to F/U after D/C. In the mean time she states she had to purchase one on her own. I reviewed the details of a nutritive latch, the I&O pages of the resource book and what red flags to report after D/C home.

Liveborn infant female weighing 820 grams with Apgars of 6 and 8.  SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY: placenta, bilateral portions of fallopian tubes  INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 28 y.o. female para 3032 with history of PPROM since 20 weeks who was hospitalized with intermittent bleeding concerning for marginal abruption began to have abdominal pain, contractions, and repetitive variable decelerations. She had received steroids at 24 and 27 weeks. Decision was made to proceed with cesarean delivery and magnesium was restarted for neuroprotection. Due to more prolonged and deeper variables, the procedure was carried out in stat fashion but with ability to obtain quick spinal anesthesia beforehand.   DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfannenstiel incision. The incision was taken down to the level of the fascia which was incised in the midline. The incision was extended laterally in either direction over the rectus muscles. The fascia was dissected off the rectus muscle bluntly. The rectus muscle was divided bluntly. The peritoneum was entered in a clear space bluntly and a few adhesions overlying the anterior lower uterine segment were taken down.  A bladder flap was not created. The lower uterine segment was examined closely and not felt to be adequate to support a low transverse uterine incision. A vertical incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with bandage scissors.  The amniotic fluid was scant but clear.  The above described infant was delivered from the Breech presentation.  The cord was doubly clamped after very brief delay and milking of the cord and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood was obtained for analysis.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap. The placenta was falling apart and with adherent blood clot. The uterus was exteriorized, and the uterine incision was closed in 3 layers, the first a runnig suture of 0-vicryl and the second a running, imbricating suture of 0-vicryl. A third baseball stitch was placed incorporating the uterine serosa.  The right fallopian tube was identified by the fimbria, double ligated with 0-chromic suture and the intervening segment excised.  The left fallopian tube was identified by the fimbria, double ligated with 0-chromic suture and the intervening segment excised.     The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity.  Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision, posterior to the bladder, and in the subfascial area.  The fascia was closed with one suture of 0 Vicryl beginning from one end of the incision and running continuously.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and re-approximated with a running suture of 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with a running subcuticular closure of 3-0 monocryl. Dermabond was applied to the incision.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.

Liveborn infant female weighing 3026 grams with Apgars of 5, 7 and 9.  Indication: [**NAME**] is a 30 y.o. female para 0121 who presented to L&D at 39w3d gestation for scheduled repeat cesarean delivery with bilateral tubal ligation.  She was consented for the above noted procedures then brought back to the operating room.  Procedure: After satisfactory anesthesia, perioperative antibiotics, the patient was prepped and draped in a routine fashion for abdominal surgery.  Time-out confirmed patient and procedure.  The abdomen was entered with a Pfannenstiel approach and dissected down to the level of the fascia with sharp dissection and cautery. The fascia was scored in the midline and extended laterally with sharp dissection. The anterior leaf of the fascia was grasped upwards and the underlying rectus muscle was dissected with sharp and blunt dissection. This was also performed inferiorly. The rectus muscles were separated in the midline and the peritoneum was entered and the underlying uterus exposed.  An Alexis O-ring Retractor was placed to aid visualization. A bladder flap was not created.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and extended laterally with blunt dissection.  Amniotic fluid was clear at the time of ROM.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation with assistance of a Kiwi vaccum.  The cord was clamped and cut and the baby handed to the pediatrician.  Blood for gases and DNA was obtained. An attempt was made to collect cord blood, but the placenta was already separating and only a small sample was obtained. The placenta was delivered with cord traction.  The uterus was then wiped out with a lap.  Ring forceps were placed on the angles of the hysterotomy as well as the upper and lower sections of the uterus.  The uterus was closed in a single layer closure using 0-Monocryl. The uterine incision was hemostatic and uterine tone adequate. Attention was then turned to the tubal ligation. The right fallopian tube was grasped with a Babcock and identified by its fimbriated end.  A small defect was made in the mesosalpinx below the grasped segment.  The tube was then doubly ligated with 0-Gut suture and the intervening segment excised.  The remaining tubal segments were hemostatic.  The same procedure was repeated on the left fallopian tube.  Portions of both tubes were passed off the surgical field and sent to pathology. The Alexis O-Ring retractor was removed.  The fascia was inspected superiorly and inferiorly and was found to be intact and hemostatic.  A Fish visceral retainer was placed below the level of the fascia to ensure safe closure.  The fascia was closed with 2 sutures of 0-Vicryl starting at the angles and running in a continuous fashion to meet the midline. The Fish retractor was removed prior to final fascial  Closure.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and made hemostatic with cautery.  The subcutaneous tissue was closed in 2 layers with 2-0 Vicryl.  The first layer contained interrupted sutures and the second layer was running.  The skin was closed with a running subcuticular stitch of 3-0 Monocryl.  Steri strips and a Bioguard dressing were applied.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.

Liveborn infant male weighing 3372 grams with Apgars of 8 and 5.  Indication: [**NAME**] is a 26 y.o. female para 2123 who presented to L&D at 37 weeks gestation for scheduled repeat cesarean delivery.  She was consented and taken to the operating room for the above noted procedures.  Prior to surgery it was confirmed that she still desired permanent surgical sterilization.  Procedure: After satisfactory anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped in a routine fashion for abdominal surgery.  Time-out confirmed patient and procedure.  The abdomen was entered with a Pfannenstiel approach and dissected down to the level of the fascia with sharp dissection and cautery. The fascia was scored in the midline and extended laterally with sharp dissection. The anterior leaf of the fascia was grasped upwards and the underlying rectus muscle was dissected with sharp and blunt dissection. The superior segment of fascia was tightly adhered to the underlying rectus muscle, therefore entry to the peritoneal cavity was achieved during separation of these layers.  This inferior segment of fascia was then grawped downwards and the underlying rectus muscle dissected. The bilateral rectus muscles were dissected horizontally to make room for delivery and the underlying uterus was exposed.  A bladder flap was not created due to an extremely thin lower uterine segment with uterine window present.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment (above the prior hysterotomy sites) with a scalpel and extended laterally with blunt dissection.  Amniotic fluid was clear at the time of rupture.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation and gave a spontaneous cry.  The cord was clamped and cut and the baby handed to the pediatrician.  Blood for gases and DNA was obtained then cord blood donatino was performed.  The placenta was delivered with cord traction.  The uterus was then exteriorized and wiped out with a lap. The uterus was closed in a single locked layer using O-Monocryl.  Attention was then turned to the tubal ligation.  A portion of the right fallopian tube was grasped in the mid-isthmic section and a defect made in the nearby mesosalpinx.  The portion of tube was double ligated with 0-Chromic and the intervening segment excised.  Hemostasis of the remaining portions was ensured.  The same procedure was repeated on the left fallopian tube. The peritoneal cavity was suctioned over a clea lap. The uterus was placed back into the peritoneal cavity. The uterine incision was hemostatic and uterine tone adequate. The fascia was inspected superiorly and inferiorly and was found to be intact and hemostatic.  The fascia was closed with 1 suture of 0-Vicryl starting at the angle and running in a continuous fashion to the opposite side. The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and closed with 3 interrupted sutures of 0-Chromic.  The skin was closed with a running subcuticular stitch of 3-0 Monocryl.  Dermabond was applied.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.  [**NAME**], MD",0

I was able to assist her with repositioning the baby in a football hold and the baby did obtain a deep asymmetric latch. The pt continued to pull back on her breast to try to view the baby. I discussed how pulling back causes the baby to loose her hold and can result in nipple trauma as well. The pt told me that she had 2 minutes left to breast feed her baby so I asked if she was timing her. She states that she was told to only breast feed for 15 minutes on each breast I re educated her about feeding cues, cluster feeding and unrestricted feeding sessions. I encouraged her to continue breast feeding as long as the baby wants to continue. I also encouraged her to offer the second breast to allow the baby more if she wants more.

Disposition: stable  Operative Report and Findings: The patient was taken to the operating room and there under spinal anesthesia her abdomen was draped and prepped in the usual sterile fashion.  A semicircular incision was made under the umbilicus and the various anatomical layers were dissected down to the layer of the parietal peritoneum.The parietal peritoneum was entered with aid of hemostats and Metzenbaum scissors.   There was good hemostasis.  The left fallopian tube was isolated with the aid of singlet forceps and the army navy retractors.  The left fallopian tube was grasped in the mid portion with a balcock clamp.  A hole was cauterized in the mesosalpinx.  The surgeon then tied 2  000 vicryl sutures on either side of the tube and the midportion was resected.  The surgeon then tied a 00 silk suture over the distal part of the proximal stump.  The same procedure was performed on the contralateral side.  There was good hemostasis and the closure of the abdomen was begun.  The parietal peritoneum was then closed with a continuous layer of 000-vicryl.   The fascia was closed with a series of 0-Monocril popoffs starting a suture from both corners of the incision.  The subcutaneous layer was closed with a continuous layer of 000-vicryl.  The skin was closed with a subcuticular stitch of 0000-proline suture.  The incision was covered with a Derma bond dressing.  Hemostasis was excellent at all levels.  The patient tolerated the procedure well under spinal anesthesia.  She was taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.

"LTM - Continuous Video Electroencephalography Note   Date of Service: [**DATE**]  Indications: status epilepticus  History: 20 y/o F who is 28 weeks pregnant with embolic L MCA stroke in [**DATE**] (due to IV drug abuse), presents with multiple breakthrough sGTCs.  Technical Summary: This is a long-term monitoring EEG performed in the inpatient setting from 05:37 am on [**DATE**] through 06:10 am on [**DATE**] utilizing a 17-channel digital videoEEG system. A standard set of electrodes were applied according to International 10-20 guidelines with dual-lead EKG recording simultaneous cardiac rhythm. Standard techniques of continuous video EEG monitoring including computerized spike and seizure detection software, technologist review and time sampling as well as patient/staff-activated pushbutton alarms were utilized.   Report:  Background Predominant Frequency: continuous diffuse polymorphic delta frequency slowing  Superimposed Frequency: abundant 8 Hz nonposterior dominant alpha activity  Rhythmic or Periodic Patterns: yes, continuous midline and left central LPDs at 1-1.5 Hz, non-evolving, non-fluctuating.  Asymmetry in Amplitude or Frequency: yes, mild asymmetry of cerebral activity decreased left hemisphere  Breach rhythm: none  Epileptiform discharges: yes, LPDs see above.  Seizures: none  Voltage: normal  Variability: yes  Reactivity: unclear  Sleep: none  Stage II sleep transients (K-complexes and spindles): none  Continuity: continuous  EKG: NSR  Clinical interpretation: This 20 minute cvEEG recording in an intubated, sedated patient on an IV midazolam gtt is abnormal due to continuous lateralized periodic discharges (LPDs) over the midline and left central region which is consistent with an acute or subacute disturbance of cerebral function, structural lesion, and/or peri-/post-ictal state involving this region. LPDs are highly associated with partial seizures. There is a mild asymmetry of cerebral activity being of decreased amplitude over the left hemisphere. These findings are consistent with a focal disturbance of cerebral function or focal lesion involving this region. The background shows a severe degree of diffuse slowing with superimposed faster frequencies in the alpha range.  These findings are consistent with a generalized anesthetic pattern due to anesthetic effect.  No seizures were present during the recording. Compared to the previous cvEEG from [**DATE**], there is no significant change.  [**NAME**], M.D.",0

"Lactation note The pt was breastfeeding at the time of my visit. She was slumped to the left side with the baby held in a football position. I inquired about her comfort level and she replied that she was not comfortable. I offered assistance which she readily accepted. The baby was held while she repositioned herself and removed her upper clothing to promote STS. The breasts were massaged and colostrum was expressed from both breasts. The nipples are well everted but very reddened and sore. The baby has a frenulum but intermittently is able to extend his tongue. He was noted to bite my gloved finger while sucking rhythmically. The baby was placed back on the left breast in a football hold with a deep latch using the nipple to nose practice. The baby was observed by both parents to suck consistently with his lips at a 90 degree angle. Pillows were used to improve the baby's body alignment and the mothers comfort. She reported a comfortable experience and felt the baby was nursing better. I reviewed the [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] breastfeeding booklet with the parents and provided them with my contact information.  [**NAME**] BSN, CLC",1

Small 2cm pedunculated fibroid on anterior uterine wall. Liveborn infant male weighing 3427 grams with Apgars of 7 and 9.  SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY: Placenta  INDICATIONS: 22 y.o. para @ 41w0d admitted in labor and augmented with pitocin. She progressed to 5cm dilation and had arrest of dilation despite adequate contractions for > 6 hours. She developed chorioamnionitis and was taken to the operating room for cesarean delivery.   DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfannenstiel incision.  A bladder flap was created.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with traction.  The amniotic fluid was clear.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut, and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatricians. A sample of cord and cord blood were obtained for analysis.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.  The uterus was exteriorized, and the corners of the uterine incision were taken in figures of 8 with 0-vicryl and the uterus was closed in a single layer of 0 Vicryl.  The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity.  The fascia was closed with a suture of 0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated with saline. The skin was closed with a subcuticular stitch of 4-0 Monocryl.  Dermabond was applied to the incision.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.  Dictated for Dr. [**NAME**], MD  I was present for the entire case.  I reviewed the resident's note and made appropriate corrections and additions to it.

Liveborn infant female weighing 1331ms with Apgars of 3 and [**DATE**].  SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY: placenta  INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 23 y.o. female para 0 undergoing induction of labor for preeclampsia.  She develop HELLP syndrome and had mild fluid overload on her chest Xray.  As she is a P0 at [**DATE**]/ballotable with the foley bulb just recently removed and likely has several hours left in her induction, will proceed with immediate delivery at this time with primary cesarean section.  DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfanenstiel incision.  A bladder flap was not created.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with traction.  The amniotic fluid was clear.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood were obtained for analysis.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.  The uterus was exteriorized, and the uterine incision was closed in two layers, the first a running suture of 0 Vicryl and the second a running, imbricating suture of 0 Vicryl.    The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity.  Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision and in the subfascial area.  The fascia was closed with a single running suture of 0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissue was closed with a running suture of 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with staples.  A Bioguard dressing was applied to the incision.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.

Prior to the procedure, it was confirmed that she desired permanent sterilization.  DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfannenstiel incision.  An incision was made in the skin with a #10 blade and was carried to the fascia.  The fascia was then scored sharply in the midline.  The fascial incision was extended bilaterally with Mayo scissors.  The anterior rectus sheath was dissected with scissors and electrocautery off the rectus abdominis superiorly and inferiorly.  The peritoneum was entered bluntly.  A bladder flap was created.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with digital traction.  The amniotic fluid was clear and voluminous.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation with the assistance of a Kiwi vacuum extractor, no pop-offs occurred.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood were obtained for analysis.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.

"Lactation Note The pt was sitting in her chair by the window with her baby draped across her lap. The baby was undressed as she had just completed a breastfeeding session.

She reports not having enough milk and is supplementing with formula for that reason. She admits to performing hand expression but not breast massage. Intervention: The pt was educated about the benefits of breast massage, hand expression and the frequent practice of STS. Frequent demand feedings in response to feeding cues was discussed and encouraged with a minimum of 8-10 breast feeding occurences in each 24 hour cycle. The [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] Breastfeeding book was provided and reviewed. Lactation F/U resources were recommended for ongoing support and assistance and contact information was noted in the back of the book. Monitoring of adequate nutrition using the baby's weight, frequency and duration of feedings, and adequate elimination patterns each day was emphasized and close observation encouraged. The baby's daily feeding record was noted and instructions for utilizing it as a tracking system for progress at home was recommended. The pt's questions were addressed while the risks of supplementing with formula and using pacifiers was discussed. The pt was encouraged to continue demand feedings without time restrictions and supplement only after the baby has completed her feeding.     Plan: Continue to provide lactation support and assistance to help the pt meet her breastfeeding goals. Reinforce cluster feeding as a newborn behavior that increases breast stimulation, increased milk production and typically indicates a growth spurt.   [**NAME**] BSN, CLC",3

Thick adhesion band in mid lower uterine segment. Significant scar tissue of fascia to anterior abdominal wall and underlying rectus muscle.  Liveborn infant female weighing 3492 grams with Apgars of 9 and 9.  SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY: none  INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 23 y.o. female para 3013 with history of prior cesarean x 2 presented for repeat cesarean delivery as scheduled at 39 weeks gestation. She declined permanent sterilization by tubal interruption.  DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through her prior incision. The incision was taken down to the level of the fascia which was incised in the midline. The incision was extended laterally in either direction over the rectus muscles. The fascia was dissected off the rectus muscle superiorly and then inferiorly as much as we were able but noted to have dense connective tissue scarring in this area. Due to difficulty separating the fascia from the underlying rectus muscle, the fascia unintentionally had a button-hole effect, approximately 5 cm in length which was repaired with several interrupted sutures of 0-vicryl and integrity of the fascia was assured.  The rectus muscle was divided bluntly. The peritoneum was entered in a clear space bluntlyly.  A bladder flap was created in essence by taking down a thick adhesion band from the mid anterior lower uterine segment where pulled up.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with the surgeon's fingers.  The amniotic fluid was clear.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood was obtained for analysis.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.  The uterus was exteriorized, and the uterine incision was closed in 2 layers, the first a running suture of 0-vicryl and the second a running, imbricating suture of 0-vicryl. The hysterotomy on the left side extended down vertically very slightly and closure of the incision was started from the inferior-most aspect on that side with running, locking sutures then continuing on to the remainder of the transverse hysterotomy closure with running, nonlocking suture.  The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity.  Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision, posterior to the bladder, and in the subfascial area.

"Attestation  I saw and evaluated the patient. I reviewed and agree with the findings and plan as documented in the note. I reviewed the patient's history. I discussed this patient with the ARNP/PA. The patient required the following critical interventions: evaluating patient, reviewing labs and imaging, discussing with consulting physicians, critical considerations of the case, discussing with patient and/or patient's family, documenting in chart and management of IV medications and drips. Comments: The patient was BIBA after she states a tree fell on top of her while shopping at a car dealership. She had (+) LOC. A c-collar was placed by ED staff after EMS delivered patient. After intial assessment of the patient's history and exam revealing hematoma on right side of scalp, bruising to right chest wall, abdomen and flank, the patinet was brought back into the trauma bay. A trauma alert was promptly called and OB, orthopedics and trauma surgery presented to bedside.   Patient denied any vaginal bleeding or leakage of fluid.  The patient had a negative FAST exam. She was hemodynamically stable as trauma surg and Ob also evaluated her.The patient had a GCS of 15 and primary complained of right sided rib pain. Her lung sounds were, clear equal and bilateral and I did not hear any wheezing. Pupils were 3mm and equally reactive. There was no hemotympany. No significant gross deformities were noted to arms or legs. The patient complained primarily of right sided rib pain, while in the ED. Her intial Chest XR was negative for any fracture or sign of pneumothorax.   In conjunction with OB and trauma surgery, decision was made not to get an immediate body CT scan given patient never became hypotensive, tachycardic or showed other signs of hemodynamic instability. Do not want to expose a fetus to such excessive amounts of radiation, unless the clinical situation indicates a life threatening abdominal or intrathoracic bleed for either mom/fetus.  At 17:00, I spoke personally to patient, she had GCS of 15 and was asking for something for rib pain, so morphine was ordered for her. Shortly after this, I signed off care of the patient. OB, trauma surgery and oncoming ED team were all aware of patient. The final disposition pends CT head/c-spine results and a full OB and trauma surgery reassment of the patient's response to therapy.

Liveborn infant female weighing 3382 grams with Apgars of 8 and 9.  SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY: none  INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 22 y.o. female para 1001 with history of prior cesarean x 1 declined tolac and thus presented for scheduled repeat cesarean delivery at 39 weeks gestation. She declined permanent sterilization by tubal interruption.  DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a pfannenstiel incision. The incision was taken down to the level of the fascia which was incised in the midline. The incision was extended laterally in either direction over the rectus muscles. The fascia was dissected off the rectus muscle superiorly and then inferiorly. The rectus muscle was divided bluntly. The peritoneum was entered in a clear space sharply.  A bladder flap was created.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with the surgeon's fingers.  The amniotic fluid was clear.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood was obtained for analysis.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.  The uterus was exteriorized, and the uterine incision was closed in 2 layers, the first a running suture of 0-vicryl and the second a running, imbricating suture of 0-vicryl.  The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity.  Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision, posterior to the bladder, and in the subfascial area.  The fascia was closed with two sutures of 0 Vicryl beginning from either end of the incision and meeting in the midportion.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and re-approximated with a interrupted sutures of 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with a running subcuticular closure of 3-0 monocryl.  Dermabond was applied to the incision.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.   Dictated for Dr. [**NAME**]",0

Scant filmy adhesions between bladder and anterior lower uterine segment. No intra-abdominal adhesions. Increased vascularity in anterior uterus both near fundus and in lower uterine segment. Liveborn infant male weighing 2602 grams with Apgars of 8 and 9. Placenta was removed intact with manual traction.  SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY:  Bilateral segments of fallopian tube  INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 35 y.o. female para 2214 at 35w6d with history of four prior cesarean deliveries presenting for scheduled repeat cesarean with possible cesarean-hysterectomy. Patient is at increased risk for morbidly adherent placenta given her history and appearance of placenta and uterus on imaging. Patient does not desire future fertility given risks of multiple cesarean deliveries and associated morbidity and mortality.  DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table. A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed. After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. A foley catheter was inserted and remained in place during the procedure. A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered through a midline vertical incision. The incision was taken down to the level of the fascia which was incised in the midline. The incision was extended inferiorly and superiorly over the rectus muscles. The rectus muscle was divided sharply. The peritoneum was entered in a clear space sharply. A bladder flap was attempted but abandoned due to increased vascularity of the uterus. A classical (vertical) incision was made in the uterine fundus anteriorly with a scalpel and the incision was extended slightly with manual traction. The amniotic fluid was scant but clear. The above described infant was in cephalic position, but due to the superior location of the hysterotomy the infant was delivered from the breech presentation. The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood was obtained for analysis.  The hysterotomy edges were clamped with ring forceps. The hysterotomy edges were secured with a running locked suture of 0 Chromic. The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the umbilical cord, and the placenta was closely inspected and noted to be intact. There was minimal bleeding from the uterus at this point. The hysterotomy was closed in a single layer with a running suture of 0 Chromic.    The left fallopian tube was identified to its fimbriated end and a defect was made in a relatively avascular portion of the mesosalpinx underlying the mid isthmic portion of the tube. A segment of the mid isthmic portion of the tube was ligated with two sutures of 0 Chromic suture and the intervening portion of the tube excised and handed off the field; adequate hemostasis was assured. The exact same procedure was performed on the opposite side after identifying that tube to its fimbriated end; again, adequate hemostasis was assured. Patient expressed desire for salpingectomy to reduce risk of fallopian tube carcinoma so the fimbriated ends of the fallopian tubes were excised with handheld Ligasure device. The fimbriated ends of fallopian tube were handed off the field to be labeled and sent to Pathology.  Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision, in the adnexa, posterior to the bladder, and in the subfascial area. The fascia was closed with two sutures of 0 Vicryl beginning from either end of the incision and meeting in the midportion. The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and re-approximated with a running suture and interrupted sutures of 3-0 Vicryl. The skin was closed with a running subcuticular closure of 3-0 Monocryl. Dermabond mesh tape (Prineo) was applied to the incision. The vagina was cleared of clots. All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.

SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY:  Segments from each tube  INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 25 y.o. female para 3225 who requests sterilization.  Patient understands this is a permanent procedure.  DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE:   The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  The abdominal cavity was entered through a small, transverse infraumbilical incision.  The left fallopian tube was identified to its fimbriated end and a defect was made in a relatively avascular portion of the mesosalpinx underlying the mid isthmic portion of the tube.  A segment of the mid isthmic portion of the tube was ligated with two sutures of 0 Chromic suture and the intervening portion of the tube was excised and handed off the field; adequate hemostasis was assured.  The exact same procedure was performed on the opposite side after identifying that tube to its fimbriated end; again, adequate hemostasis was assured.  The fascia was closed with a running suture of 0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissue was reapproximated with 0 vicryl.  The skin incision was closed with a running subcuticular suture of monocryl.  The patient was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.  All counts were correct at the end of the procedure.  [**NAME**], MD OB/GYN PGY1",0

Liveborn infant male weighing 2864 grams with Apgars of 8 and 9. The patient underwent induction of labor with foley bulb, pitocin, and AROM and remained at 4 cm cervical dilation for 24 hours. During this time the FHT demonstrated minimal variability with intermittent late appearing decelerations. The decision was made to proceed with a repeat cesarean section.  SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY: None  INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 23 y.o. female para 2012 at 40w4d GA who was admitted for scheduled induction of labor in the setting or a prior cesarean section.   DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfannenstiel incision.  The subcutaneous tissue was incised with the scalpel. The fascia was scored with the scalpel. The fascial incision was extended bilaterally with curved mayo scissors. The fascia was dissected away from the rectus muscle with blunt dissection, electrocautery, and curved mayo scissors. The rectus muscle was divided at the midline and then laterally on the left. The left lateral division was made due to very thickened peritoneum located at the midline. The peritoneum was entered with Metzenbaum scissors at the left lateral division of the rectus muscle. The rectus muscle and the peritoneum was divided toward the midline with electrocautery. The peritoneal incision was then extended with gentle traction. A bladder flap was created.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended with traction. The hysterotomy was extended superiorly at bilateral angles.  The amniotic fluid was clear.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood were obtained for analysis.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.  The uterus was exteriorized, and the uterine incision was closed in a single layer, a running locking suture of 0-Monocryl.   The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity.  Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision and in the subfascial area.  The fascia was closed with a single running suture of 0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissue was closed with two layers of running suture of 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with a running subcuticular closure of 3-0 Monocryl.  Dermabond was applied to the incision.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.  Complications: none  [**NAME**] M.D.  I was present for the entire case.

Pacifier should be discouraged until breastfeeding is well established. Encouraged patient that it is normal for infant to breastfeed often. Explained cluster feeding and that allowing infant to go to breast with feeding cues provides proper stimulation for milk production. Also assisted patient in latching infant to R breast in football hold with nipple shield. Infant obtained good latch with 1-2 attempts and began sucking rhythmically. Audible swallowing heard. Infant then became sleepy, demonstrated to patient breast compression, which caused infant to begin breastfeeding again. Patient encouraged and was able to demonstrate as well.

"Assessment: Pt seems very anxious, states breastfeeding was quite painful overnight .  Expresses concern re: infant not able to stay deeply latched during feedings.  Infant is currently being taken to procedure room with Peds team/ FOB for frenotomy.  Breasts are soft, well-developed.  Nipples are everted and intact, appear pinched.  Pt was shown how to hand express her breasts, and drops of colostrum noted bilaterally. Infant returned to room post-frenotomy during visit, actively extending tongue/rooting.  Intervention: Assisted pt to latch infant in clutch hold on right breast with deep latch and rhythmic suck.  Pt reports nipple discomfort initially with latch, transitioning to a tolerable soreness within a couple of minutes.  Discussed importance of asymmetrical, chin-led latch, as well as allowing infant to determine feeding times by observing infant for feeding cues.  Instructed to allow infant to finish on one breast, using breast compressions to maximize feeding time before switching to second breast at each feeding.  Reviewed nipple care, typical cluster feeding behavior, infant stomach capacity and expected output for infant.  Also discussed managing possible milk oversupply during milk onset. Discouraged use of pacifiers or artificial nipples until breastfeeding is well-established, around 3-4 weeks of age. Encouraged maximizing skin to skin time with infant over the next several days as well.  Infant finished on right, talked pt through burping, began rooting again and assisted to latch infant to left breast in clutch position, again with deep latch.  Before end of feeding, pt was able to independently latch infant on both breasts with minimal discomfort.

Baby A (intact): Liveborn infant male weighing 680 grams with Apgars of 6 and 8. Baby B (PPROM): Liveborn infant male weighing 570 grams with Apgars of 6 and 6.   SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY: Placenta  INDICATIONS: 25 y.o. para 0 at 24w0d admitted with dichorionic diamniotic twins due to premature preterm rupture of membranes of twin A at 21 weeks. She received a betamethasone course at 23w4d and was given antibiotics for latency. At 24w0d, she began having painful contractions. On sterile speculum exam, she was dilated to 4cm and she had milky discharge. She had a temperature of 37.9C with fetal tachycardia and therefore chorioamnionitis was suspected. She progressed to 6cm dilation and was therefore taken to the operating room for cesarean delivery.   DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfannenstiel incision.  A bladder flap was not created.  A classical incision was made in the uterus segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended superiorly with bandage scissors. The amniotic fluid surrounding the non-presenting twin was clear and ruptured with an Allis clamp. The previously described twin B was delivered first from the breech presentation and will now be called twin A.  The second twin (PPROM) was also delivered from breech presentation. The cords were doubly clamped and cut, and the babies were handed to the awaiting pediatricians. A sample of cord and cord blood were obtained for analysis.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.  The uterus was exteriorized, and the uterus was closed in 4 layers, first a running stitch of 0 Vicryl, then a running imbricating layer of 0 Vicryl. The 3rd layer was created using a series of horizontal mattress sutures of 0 Vicryl just under the serosal layer. The final layer was a baseball stitch using 2-0 Vicryl. The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity.  The fascia was closed with a suture of 0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated with saline.  The subcutaneous tissue was approximated with a running suture of 2-0 vicryl.  The skin was closed with a subcuticular stitch of 3-0 monocryl.  Dermabond was applied to the incision.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.  [**NAME**], MD",0

Liveborn infant male weighing 2972 grams with Apgars of 8 and 9.  SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY: None  INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 26yo P0020 who was admitted at 39 weeks gestation with severely elevated blood pressures indicative of pre-eclampsia with severe features. On arrival, she had a category 2 fetal heart tracing. She was admitted and started on magnesium therapy and prior to starting pitocin induction of labor, she began contracting every 4-5 minutes. She then began having deep variable decelerations that could not be resolved with intrauterine resuscitation and was therefore taken to the operating room for Stat cesarean delivery.  DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table. A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed. After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.  The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfanenstiel incision. The fascia was scored in the midline and extended with sharp dissection laterally. The underlying rectus muscle was dissected off the fascia with blunt dissection. The rectus muscles were separated in the midline with blunt dissection and the peritoneum was entered bluntly. A bladder flap was not created. A low transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with traction. The amniotic fluid was meconium stained. The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation with the assistance of a Kiwi vacuum. There were no pop offs. The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood were obtained for analysis. Cord blood for donation was collected. The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap. The uterus was exteriorized, and the uterine incision was closed in two layers, the first a running suture of 0 Monocryl and the second a running, imbricating suture of 0 Monocryl.  The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity. Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision and in the subfascial area. The fascia was closed with a single running suture of 0 Vicryl. The subcutaneous fat was closed with a running suture of 3-0 Vicryl. The skin was closed with a running subcuticular closure of 3-0 Monocryl. Dermabond was applied to the incision. The vagina was cleared of clots. All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.   [**NAME**], MD",0

After placement of spinal anesthesia, fetal bradycardia to the 60s was noted. Decision was made to proceed with emergent cesarean delivery.   DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt. Fetal bradycardia was noted.

A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through prior Pfanenstiel incision.  The incision was taken down to the level of the fascia which was incised in the midline with scalpel. The incision was extended laterally in either direction over the rectus muscles.  The rectus muscle was divided sharply with a scalpel. The peritoneum was entered bluntly.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with the surgeon's fingers.  The amniotic fluid was clear upon rupture.

The uterus was exteriorized, and the uterine incision was closed in  a running suture of 0 Vicryl. Additional sutures of 0 Vicryl were placed along hysterotomy for additional hemostasis.   The right fallopian tube was identified to its fimbriated end and a defect was made in a relatively avascular portion of the mesosalpinx underlying the mid isthmic portion of the tube.  A segment of the mid isthmic portion of the tube was ligated with two sutures of 0 Chromic suture and the intervening portion of the tube excised and handed off the field; adequate hemostasis was assured.  The exact same procedure was performed on the opposite side after identifying that tube to its fimbriated end; again, adequate hemostasis was assured.  The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity.  Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision, posterior to the bladder, and in the subfascial area.  The fascia was closed with one suture of 0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and closed with running suture of 3-0 vicryl.

Liveborn infant female weighing 2438 grams with Apgars of 8 and 9. Very scant clear amniotic fluid. Placenta appeared to have approximately 20% abruption along the margin.   SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY: Placenta  INDICATIONS: 29 y.o. para 0111 at 33w5d admitted with pre-eclampsia, oligohydramnios and intrauterine growth restriction. On daily nonstress test, she was found to have repetitive prolonged variable and late decelerations not responsive to intrauterine resuscitation and was therefore taken to the operating room for cesarean delivery.   DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfannenstiel incision.  A bladder flap was not created.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with tractiong.  The amniotic fluid was very scant but clear.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut, and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatricians. A sample of cord and cord blood were obtained for analysis.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.  The uterus was exteriorized, and closed in 2 layers, the first a running suture of 0 Vicryl and the second a running, imbricating suture of 0 Vicryl.  The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity.  The fascia was closed with a suture of 0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated with saline.  The subcutaneous tissue was approximated with a running suture of 3-0 vicryl.  The skin was closed with a subcuticular stitch of 3-0 monocryl.  Dermabond was applied to the incision.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.   [**NAME**], MD",0

Both boys are sleepy. We attempted to waken the babies for latching but unsuccessfully. Hand expression yielded some drops of colostrum but not enough to put in a spoon or syringe. I provided a pump showing her the parts for assembly and disassembly.

"Date of Surgery: [**DATE**]  PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  1) Intrauterine pregnancy at 39 weeks 2) Prior cesarean x 1 3) Fetal transposition of the great arteries  POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  1) Intrauterine pregnancy at 39 weeks 2) Prior cesarean x 1 3) Fetal transposition of the great arteries  PROCEDURE:  1) Repeat low transverse cesarean section  SURGEON: Oguneleye ASSISTANTS: [**NAME**]  ANESTHESIOLOGIST: [**NAME**] ANESTHESIA ASSISTANT: [**NAME**]  ANESTHESIA: Spinal  EBL: 1000 mL  FLUID REPLACEMENT: 1500 mL  FINDINGS: Severe pelvic adhesive disease between the anterior body of the uterus and the anterior abdominal wall. Severe adhesions also between the lower uterine segment to the bladder. Thick band of adhesion at the uterine fundus that precluded exteriorization. Normal uterus, tubes and ovaries bilaterally.  Liveborn infant male weighing 3864 grams with Apgars of 7 and 9.  SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY: None  INDICATIONS: 26 y.o. para 1001 at 39w1d admitted for scheduled repeat cesarean delivery. This pregnancy is complicated by fetal transposition of the great arteries. She has had a prior cesarean delivery and declines trial of labor.   DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfannenstiel incision. Severe adhesive disease was encountered. A bladder flap was not created.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with traction.  The amniotic fluid was clear.  The left rectus muscle was cut with bandage scissors to allow for delivery of the fetal head. The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut, and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatricians. A sample of cord and cord blood were obtained for analysis.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.  The uterus was NOT exteriorized due to severe adhesions. The corner of the uterine incision was closed with a figure of 8 with 0-monocryl and the uterus was closed in 2 layers, the first a running suture of 0 monocryl and the second a running suture of 0 monocryl. The uterine incision was examined closely and was hemostatic.  The fascia was closed with a suture of 0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated with saline.  The subcutaneous tissue was approximated with interrupted sutures of 3-0 chormic.  The skin was closed with a subcuticular stitch of 4-0 monocryl.  Dermabond was applied to the incision.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.  [**NAME**], MD",0

"Attending note.  I met with the patient and her partner together with Drs. Egerman from MFM, Dr. [**NAME**] from neonatology, and Dr. [**NAME**] to discuss a plan of care.  Briefly, Ms. [**NAME**] is a 27 yo P2002 at 25 4/7 wks who has been followed by HROB and peds cardiology since approximately 20 weeks gestation at which time she was diagnosed with fetal non-immune hydrops.  Infectious disease workup and fetal ECHO did not reveal underlying etiology.  Pregnancy o/w complicated by CHTN on aldomet and procardia.  She presented today for follow-up outpatient fetal ECHO which showed significantly worsening fetal hydrops.  She was then directly admitted for fetal monitoring and a betamethasone course and evaluation of elevated BPs with concern for possible mirror syndrome.    On admission, initial BPs noted to be 130's-170's/90's-110's.  No s/s preE.  Pt had not taken her anti-HTN meds today, and was given labetalol 20mg IV x 1 dose with subsequent BPs noted to be 120-130's/80-90's.  PreE panel shows nl plts,LFTs and Cr.  Pr/Cr ratio = 361.  Pt is currently receiving magnesium sulfate for sz prophylaxis and has received her 1st dose of betamethasone at 1640.  FHT currently shows decreased variability with repetitive variable decelerations.  Together we again discussed the poor fetal prognosis with likely in-utero fetal demise if the pregnancy continues.  The patient is also aware that there is low chance of fetal survival with delivery at this GA.  The chance of survival cannot be well-predicted without knowing how much functional lung tissue is present.  The patient was offered comfort measures for the baby if the baby is delivered and the neonatologists feel that invasive intervention would be futile.  The patient requests full intervention for the baby if delivery is recommended at this time.  In making a decision for delivery to try to maximize fetal survival, the decision is based on whether or not we can try to get a full course of betamethasone administered prior to complete fetal deterioration vs. whether or not delaying delivery would lead to a stat C/S under GA in the setting of fetal bradycardia which would likely further diminish chances of fetal survival in this already compromised baby.  We have discussed with the patient that our recommendation is to proceed with cesarean delivery now due to FHR concerns.  I also again addressed the patient's previous desire to have permanent sterilization.  We again discussed the risk of regret, and the patient has decided to opt for a non-permanent method of birth control until she can give further consideration to permanent sterilization.  Currently preparing to transfer pt to OR for C/S.  Anesthesia aware.  [**NAME**], MD Assistant Professor Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**]",0

"ROUTINE EEG  Date: [**DATE**]- [**DATE**]  Reason for EEG:  Spells concerning for seizure  History: 31 y.o. right-handed  female, currently 34 weeks pregnant, with a previous history of fibromyalgia, bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, substance abuse (alcohol, opiates, currently on methadone), chronic pain, and some report of seizure (not on seizure meds) without further information, who was found down at home, unresponsive and seen to be shaking by husband or EMS.  Technical summary:  This long term EEG was performed utilizing the 21-channel digital system.    Report:   Posterior basic rhythm was not identified.  Spontaneous variability was present.Reactivity was present.  Beta activity of low amplitude was present at  10-20  hz, bilaterally.  Theta activity of low amplitude is present, at  3-5  hz,  bilaterally.   Drowsiness:  Intermittent bilateral slowing was noted suggestive of drowsy periods.  Occasional bursts of bilateral beta activity was noted which could represent poorly formed spindles.   Abnormal activity Continuous delta activity was present bilaterally, at times quasi-rhythmic, sharply contoured in morphology,  maximal on the right, over the  parietal-occipital head regions.  Intermittent sharp waves/ spikes, at times occurring in short runs lasting 4-5 seconds, at 1 hz,  were noted over the central-parieto-occipital regions, bilaterally and incependently on both right and left, maximal on the right  Intermittently the slow waves organised into rhythmic periodic discharges, seen bilaterally when the patient was being cared for by providers, suggesting the possibility of stimulation induced rhythmic periodic discharges (SIRPIDS)   Clinical interpretation:   This is a moderately abnormal EEG because:  - continuous delta slowing noted bilaterally , maximal over the right posterior quadrants.  - Intermittent sharp waves sometimes in short runs, noted over the central-parieto-occipital regions, bilaterally and independently on both right and left, maximal on the right.   - periods of SIRPIDS, when the patient was being cared for by providers.  - Absence of normal physiological rythms.   The EEG is suggestive of a diffuse cerebral disturbance with epileptogenicisty noted over the central-parieto-occipital regions on both sides.  Also intermittent SIRPIDS were noted which could suggest an epiletogenic potential.  SIRPIDS are usually noted when there is a change in the neurological status.

Discussed with her that at this EFW some providers would offer her a primary cesarean section to decrease the risk of shoulder dystocia and overall maternal and fetal/neonatal morbidity/mortaliity. we would not offer a primary cesarean section and proceed with vaginal delivery. She does understand the limitations of third trimester ultrasound. Discussed with her the possibility of shoulder dystocia at this EFW and any EFW really as shoulder dystocias cannot be predicted (although there are risk factors) and 50% of shoulder dystocias occur in the setting of a baby < 4000g. Specifically, discussed the maneuvers we perform to reduce a shoulder dystocia and the complications of a shoulder dystocia including but not limited to fetal clavicle/humerus fracture, fetal hypoxia, maternal laceration, and fetal death. Also, discussed with patient that we will have a low threshold for cesarean section in the setting of an abnormal labor curve, avoidance of operative vaginal delivery, and preparation for maternal postpartum hemorrhage. Patient voices understanding of shoulder dystocia and its complications and agrees with plan to proceed with vaginal delivery.   [**NAME**], MD",0

Liveborn infant male weighing 3240 grams with Apgars of 8 and 9.  SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY:  Placenta  INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 23 y.o. female para 0 at 39w1d with hepatitis C infection with viral load greater than 7 million. Given increased risk for vertical transmission in the event of vaginal delivery, the patient was scheduled for primary cesarean delivery.  DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table. A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed. After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfannenstiel incision. The incision was taken down to the level of the fascia which was incised in the midline. The incision was extended laterally in either direction over the rectus muscles. The fascia was dissected off the rectus muscle superiorly and then inferiorly. The rectus muscle was divided bluntly. The peritoneum was entered in a clear space sharply.  A bladder flap was created. A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with blunt dissection.  The amniotic fluid was clear. The above described infant was delivered from the cephalic presentation. The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood was obtained for analysis. The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.  The uterus was exteriorized, and the uterine incision was closed in two layers, the first a running suture of 0Vicryl and the second a running, imbricating suture of 0 Vicryl.    The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity. Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision, posterior to the bladder, and in the subfascial area. The fascia was closed with a running suture of 0 Vicryl. The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and re-approximated with interrupted sutures of 3-0 Vicryl. The skin was closed with a running subcuticular closure of 4-0 Monocryl. Dermabond was applied to the incision. The vagina was cleared of clots. All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.   [**NAME**], M.D.",0

Extension involving the R uterine artery, hemostatic after O'leary. Liveborn infant female weighing 3136 grams with Apgars of 9 and 9.  SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY: Bilateral portion of tubes  INDICATIONS: 43 y.o. para 1011 at 39w0d admitted for induction of labor due to advanced maternal age, gestational diabetes and decreased fetal movement. She progressed in labor to completely dilated but began having repetitive deep variable decelerations with the second stage refractory to intrauterine resuscitation. Therefore, she was taken to the operating room for cesarean delivery. She had previously requested bilateral tubal interruption for sterilization.   DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfannenstiel incision.  A bladder flap was not created.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with traction.  The amniotic fluid was clear.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut, and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatricians. A sample of cord and cord blood were obtained for analysis.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.    The uterus was exteriorized, and the uterus was closed in a single layers of a running suture of 0 Vicryl. Additional hemostasis was achieved with figure of eight sutures of 0 Vicryl. The right corner of the hysterotomy was bleeding briskly and appeared to involve the uterine artery. An O'leary stitch was then performed with a 0 Vicryl in order to achieve hemostasis.    The right fallopian tube was identified to its fimbriated end and a defect was made in a relatively avascular portion of the mesosalpinx underlying the mid isthmic portion of the tube.  A segment of the mid isthmic portion of the tube was ligated with two sutures of 0 Chromic suture and the intervening portion of the tube excised and handed off the field; adequate hemostasis was assured.  The exact same procedure was performed on the opposite side after identifying that tube to its fimbriated end; again, adequate hemostasis was assured.  The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity and the hysterotomy was hemostatic.  The fascia was closed with a suture of 0 Vicryl, beginning at each end and meeting in the midline.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated with saline.  The subcutaneous tissue was approximated with interrupted a running suture of 3-0 vicryl.  The skin was closed with a subcuticular stitch of 3-0 monocryl.  Dermabond was applied to the incision and it was covered with a Bioguard bandage.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.  [**NAME**], MD",0

Normal right ovary.  Left ovary surgically absent.  Liveborn infant male weighing 2942 grams with Apgars of 7 and 9.  Moderate adhesions at the level of the rectus abdominus muscles.  Uterus initially boggy after delivery of fetus accounting for elevated EBL.  Indication: [**NAME**] is a 33 y.o. female para 1111 at 37w3d who presented for scheduled repeat cesarean.  She had a history of cesarean at 32 weeks with unknown scar.  That pregnancy resulted in stillbirth.  She also had history of laparotomy for endometriosis that resulted in a left ureteral transection that required stents. Cesarean delivery was recommended due to history of unknown prior cesarean scar.  She received 1 unit of packed red blood cells prior to the case due to post-op anemia (Hgb 6.8).  Procedure: After satisfactory anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped in a routine fashion for abdominal surgery. Time-out confirmed patient and procedure. The abdomen was entered with a Pfannensteil approach.  The superior aspect of the fascial incision was grasped upward and the underlying rectus muscle was dissected away with a combination of sharp and blunt dissection.  Attention was then turned to the inferior aspect which was grasped upward and underlying rectus muscles were dissected away with sharp dissection.  The rectus muscles were separated in the midline and the peritoneum was entered with sharp dissection while maintaining visualization of the bowel and bladder.  A bladder flap was created with Metzenbaum scissors.  A low transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and extended laterally.  Amniotic fluid was clear. The above described infant was delivered from the cephalic presentation. Nuchal cord x 2 was reduced after delivery of fetus.  The cord was clamped and the cord was cut and the baby handed to the pediatrician who was present for delivery. Blood for gases and DNA was obtained. The placenta was delivered with cord traction.   The uterus was cleared of clots and debris. The uterus was exteriorized. The uterus was closed with a two layer closure; initial layer was a 0-vicryl locking layer; the second layer was an imbricating layer of 0-vicryl.  The abdominal cavity posterior to the uterus was wiped with a moist lap.  The uterus was replaced into the patient's abdomen. The hysterotomy was hemostatic as was the fascia and rectus muscles. The abdominal gutters were wiped with a moist lap.  Urine was noted to be clear throughout procedure.  The fascia was closed with 0-Vicryl starting at the angle and running in a continuous fashion. The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated with normal saline and was found to be hemostatic. The subcutaneous tissue was reapproximated with 2-0 vicryl.  The skin was closed with with 0-monocryl.

No involvement with anterior abdominal wall. Bladder adherent. Unclear if rectal involvement.  Liveborn infant male weighing 3124 grams with Apgars of 3, 6, and 6, at 1 minutes, five minutes, and ten minutes respectively.   CORD GASES: No Cord gases collected, Fetal DNA sample sent    SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY:  ID Type Source Tests Collected by Time  A :  Tissue Surg Path Umbilical Cord OPTIME SURGICAL PATHOLOGY TISSUE [**NAME**], MD [**DATE**] 1054     INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 40 y.o. female P2143 with history of prior cesarean x2, and  known placenta previa with suspected placenta percreta who was taken to the operating room for cesarean delivery at 36w5d gestation, with plan for staged hysterectomy approximately 24 hours later.   DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the Operating Room and placed on the operating table in the dorsal supine position.  A briefing was held and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was placed in low lithotomy position in Allen stirrups.  A final time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  It was confirmed that the patient had received prophylactic antibiotics and that pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.    Urology proceeded with diagnostic cytoscopy and bilateral ureteral stent placement (please see their operative note for further details).  Large varicosities seen through the bladder wall, not penetrating the mucosa. After completion of Urology portion of procedure, the patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion .   Entry:  The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a vertical midline incision above the umbilicus. The incision was taken down to the level of the fascia which was incised in the midline using scalpel.  The peritoneum was entered carefully with blunt dissection.   At this time a careful exploration of the pelvis was completed. A placenta percreta was confirmed, with placenta through myometrium and the lower portion of the uterus on the left and into bladder. At this time a sterile ultrasound probe was brought onto surgical field and used to plan hysterotomy. Decision was made to make a vertical hysterotomy near the right fundal region of the uterus in order to avoid the placenta. The hysterotomy was made with scalpel and gently extended with blunt dissection. The amnionitic fluid was clear upon rupture. The fetus was delivered via cephalic position. The cord was doubly clamped and handed off to the neonatal team who was at warmer in the operating room.     At this time the edges of the hysterotomy were closed with a running, locking suture of 0-Chromic for adequate hemostasis. The umbilical cord was tied and the placenta in-situ for later planned hysterectomy after extensive interventional radiology embolization. The hysterotomy was then closed in a running, locking fashion using a running suture of 0-Chromic. An additional suture of 2-0 vicryl was used to place a box stitch for additional hemostasis. Adequate hemostasis was ensured along hysterotomy.    The fascia was closed with a running suture of 0-PDS. Adequate hemostasis was ensured within subcutaneous tissue. The skin was then re-approximated with staples. A Bioguard dressing was placed over incision. A debriefing was held at the completion of the procedure; all counts were correct and no isses were identified.    Upon completion of cesarean delivery, patient was then transferred intubated to interventional radiology suite for further embolization of pelvic vessels, as planned for staged hysterectomy within 24 hours in order to minimize blood loss (please see their note for further details). Upon transfer to IR suite, patient was stable with minimal vaginal bleeding.   Dictated for Dr. [**NAME**], MD",0

Given dense keloid present at prior scar, decision was made to revise scar.   DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through patient's prior Pfannenstiel incision. The dense scar tissue present on left side of scar was excised in an ellipsoid manner. The incision was taken down to the level of the fascia which was incised in the midline. The incision was extended laterally in either direction over the rectus muscles. The fascia was dissected off the rectus muscle superiorly and then inferiorly. The rectus muscle was separated and the peritoneum was bluntly.  The bladder blade was placed. A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with the surgeon's fingers. The amniotic fluid was clear upon rupture.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood was obtained for analysis.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.  The uterus was exteriorized, and the uterine incision was closed in two layers, the first a running suture of 0 Vicryl and the second a running, imbricating suture of 0 Vicryl.    The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity.  Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision, posterior to the bladder, and in the subfascial area.  The fascia was closed with one suture of 0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissue was copiously irrigated closed with a interrupted sutures of 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with a running subcuticular closure of 3-0 Monocryl. Dermabond and a sterile Bioguard dressing were applied to the incision.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.  Dictated for Dr. [**NAME**], MD",0

CORD GASES: Arterial  BABY A:7.33 BABY B: 7.23  Venous  BABY A: 7.32 BABY B: 7.29   SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY:  Segments from each tube  INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 28 y.o. female P0202 with Di/Di twin pregnancy at 37 weeks, with history of CHTN (on labetalol 200 mg BID),prior cesarean x2, who presented for her scheduled repeat cesarean delivery with bilateral tubal ligation as she desired no future fertility. She was taken to the operating room for the above procedures.   DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through patient's prior Pfanenstiel incision. The incision was taken down to the level of the fascia which was incised in the midline with scalpel. The incision was extended laterally in either direction over the rectus muscles. The fascia was dissected off the rectus muscle superiorly and then inferiorly. The rectus muscle was divided sharply with a scalpel. The peritoneum was entered sharply in a clear space sharply. A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with the surgeon's fingers.  The amniotic fluid was clear upon rupture. Baby A was delivered from the Breech presentation.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood was obtained for analysis. Baby B was delivered from the cephalic position.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood was obtained for analysis.   The placentas were delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.  The uterine incision was closed in two layers, the first a running suture of 0 Vicryl and the second a running, imbricating suture of 0 Vicryl.    The right fallopian tube was identified to its fimbriated end and a defect was made in a relatively avascular portion of the mesosalpinx underlying the mid isthmic portion of the tube.  A segment of the mid isthmic portion of the tube was ligated with two sutures of 0 Chromic suture and the intervening portion of the tube excised and handed off the field; adequate hemostasis was assured.  The exact same procedure was performed on the opposite side after identifying that tube to its fimbriated end; again, adequate hemostasis was assured.  Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision, posterior to the bladder, and in the subfascial area.  The fascia was closed with a running suture of 0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and closed with a running suture of 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with a running subcuticular closure of 3-0 Monocryl. Dermabond was applied to the incision.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.  [**NAME**], MD",0

Normal uterus, tubes and ovaries bilaterally.  Liveborn infant female weighing 2102 grams with Apgars of 9 and 9.  SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY:  Segments from each tube  INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 31 y.o. female para 3113 who presented with PPROM at 33 weeks.  She was given PPROM antibiotics and delivery was scheduled by repeat cesarean for 34 weeks.   DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfannenstiel incision.  A bladder flap was not created, however the bladder was backfilled to identify bladder reflection, as there were adhesions between anterior uterine wall and bladder.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended with traction.  The amniotic fluid was clear. The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood were obtained for analysis.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.  The uterus was exteriorized, and the uterine incision was closed in one layers,  a running suture of 0 Vicryl.  The right fallopian tube was identified to its fimbriated end and a defect was made in a relatively avascular portion of the mesosalpinx underlying the mid isthmic portion of the tube.  A segment of the mid isthmic portion of the tube was ligated with two sutures of 0 Chromic suture and the intervening portion of the tube excised and handed off the field; adequate hemostasis was assured.  The exact same procedure was performed on the opposite side after identifying that tube to its fimbriated end; again, adequate hemostasis was assured.  The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity.  Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision and in the subfascial area.  The fascia was closed with a two running suture of 0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissue was closed with a running suture of 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with a running subcuticular closure of 3-0 Monocryl.  Dermabond was applied to the incision.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.  Complications: None  [**NAME**] MD  I was present and scrubbed for the entire procedure.

Her other prenatal complications are listed under pre-operative diagnoses above. For further details see admission H&P from [**DATE**]. She was admitted and started on Mg for neuroprotection. She had recently received a BMS course (completed [**DATE**]) therefore this was not initially repeated. She was stable for approximately 36 hours although FHR tracing showed occasional decelerations and segments of decreased variability. On [**DATE**] she developed increasingly painful contractions. On exam the cervix was noted to be 4cm dilated with the cerclage pulling through. Additionally, she was found to have purulent vaginal discharge and fundal tenderness. Given overall clinical picture concerning for chorioamnionitis, the stitch was removed and she was started on antibiotic treatment. After several hours, the cervix was dilated to only 6cm, therefore she was also augmented with pitocin. Over the next 4 hours, no significant cervical change occurred. The FHR tracing showed decreased variability and more frequent decelerations. Given nonreassuring fetal heart rate tracing with minimal BTBV, small accelerations, and early vs late decelerations, despite conservative intrauterine measures in the setting of likely chorioamnionitis plan was made to proceed with cesarean section at this time. It was confirmed that the patient still desired tubal ligation regardless of the outcome of the pregnancy. Postoperatively the pt is doing well. By POD2 she was able to ambulate, void, and tolerate a regular diet.Her suagrs werre well ctonrolled on AM: 18nph/15R and PM: 15NPH/7R Her pain was well controlled and her lochia was less than menses.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table. A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed. After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfannenstiel incision. The subcutaneous tissue was incised with the scalpel. The fascia was scored with a scalpel. The fascial incision was extended bilaterally with gentle traction.  The peritoneum was entered bluntly. The peritoneal incision was extended with traction and electrocautery.  A bladder flap was created. A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended with traction. The amniotic fluid was clear.

I spoke with the primary team this am including Dr. [**NAME**] I had reviewed the MRI studies as well as neurosurgery notes and attempted to see the patient in the afternoon but she was being cleaned up at that time. Later in the afternoon I was called and the primary team had decided to take her for c section. The MRI findings were interesting but difficult to explain. It appeared that she had adherence of a large section of the ventral cord beginning at around T4 (localizes well to her exam). Contrast was not given given the pregnancy. Neurosurgery had recommended EMG. While it was thought that this could possibly be helpful it will not be something that will happen over the weekend.  The patient will be signed out to Dr. [**NAME**] who will be rounding tomorrow.,0

She progressed to 5-6 cm and completley dilated, but made no further cervical change despite adequate contractions. She was taken to the operating room for a primary cesarean. During dosing of her epidural per anesthesia she was noted to have respiratory distress consistent with a high spinal. An emergent cesarean section was performed with conversion to general anesthesia.   DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed. During dosing of her epidural per anesthesia she was noted to have respiratory distress consistent with a high spinal. An emergent cesarean section was performed with conversion to general anesthesia.   The patient was already in the dorsal supine position, and her abdomen was draped in a STAT manner.  A second time-out was quickly taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed. The neonatology team was called to OR. It was confirmed patient had received her prophylactic antibiotics shortly and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning after skin incision was made.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfannenstiel incision. The incision was taken down to the level of the fascia which was incised in the midline with scalpel. The incision was extended laterally in either direction over the rectus muscles. The peritoneum was entered bluntly.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with the surgeon's fingers. The amniotic fluid was foul smelling and meconium stained upon hysterotomy.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood was obtained for analysis.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.  The uterus was exteriorized, and the uterine incision was closed in two layers, the first a running suture of 0 Vicryl and the second a running, imbricating suture of 0 Vicryl.  Additional intravenous pitocin was administered as uterine tone was boggy.   The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity and uterine tone improved. Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision, posterior to the bladder, and in the subfascial area. The posterior cul de sac and bilateral paracolic gutters were wiped clean with a lap.  The fascia was closed with two sutures of 0 Vicryl beginning from either end of the incision and meeting in the midportion.  The subcutaneous tissue was copiously irrigated and closed with multiple running layers of 3-0 Vicryl. The skin was closed with a running subcuticular closure of 3-0 Monocryl.  Dermabond, and a sterile Bioguard dressing were applied to the incision.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  Patient was extubated without complication per anesthesia. All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.

Liveborn infant male weighing 3364 grams with Apgars of 8 and 9.  SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY: Placenta  INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 36 y.o. female para 1011 at 38w5d GA with pregnancy complicated by diet-controlled gestational diabetes, advanced maternal age who presents with spontaneous rupture of membranes and breech fetal malpresentation. Given the fetal malpresentation the decision was made to proceed with delivery by cesarean section.   DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfannenstiel incision.  The subcutaneous tissue was incised with electrocautery. The fascia was scored with the scalpel. The fascial incision was extended with curved mayo scissors and gentle traction. The fascia was dissected away from the rectus muscle with a combination of sharp and blunt dissection. The rectus muscle was divided at the midline. The peritoneum was entered bluntly. The peritoneal incision was extended with electrocautery. A bladder flap was created.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended with traction.  The amniotic fluid was clear.  The above described infant was delivered from the Breech presentation using standard breech maneuvers.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood were obtained for analysis.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.  The uterus was exteriorized, and the uterine incision was closed in two layers, the first a running suture of 0 Monocryl and the second a running, imbricating suture of 0 Monocryl. An additional figure of eight suture of 0-Monocryl was placed along the hysterotomy for hemostasis.    The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity.  Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision and in the subfascial area.  The fascia was closed with a single running suture of 0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissue was closed with a running suture of 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with a running subcuticular closure of 3-0 Monocryl.  Dermabond was applied to the incision.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.  Complications: none  [**NAME**] M.D.   I was scrubbed and present for the entire case.  I reviewed the resident's note and made appropriate corrections and additions to it.   [**NAME**], MD",0

Discussed with Patient Dynamics of post-partum depression & appropriate resources for assistance;Benefits of family planning and safe sex practices;Aspects of parenting and coping strategies  Information only re: SIDS, Shaken Baby Syndrome, Back to Sleep.  No further social work interventions planned unless otherwise contacted Yes   Social work met privately with MOB re: teen mother and medical team concerns related to MOB ability to properly feed and care for newborn.  It should be noted that most of this assessment occurred while newborn was in the procedure room.  MOB reports residing in a safe and stable home environment with her parents and [**NAME**] (24y/o).  MOB reports FOB has been residing in the home ""since my car accident"" 11 months ago.  MOB reports she was driving a car that was ""t-boned on the driver side door"" at 55mph.  She reports she was trapped in the car for 45 minutes and needed to be extracted from the vehicle.  She reports emergency responders thought she was ""deceased.""  MOB reports she had multiple ""leg and knee"" injuries, but that she had no other physical injuries.  MOB reports she remembers the accident and has had good support with her family and FOB to help her get through the emotional trauma.      MOB reports she no longer attends high school, indicating she left because she was experiencing bullying.  MOB reports she was in regular education classes, but is now currently attempting to earn her GED.  She reports she has half of her credits needed, but one of the few classes she can't pass is math.  MOB denies any disabilities.  She reports she has previously worked for FWC (Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission) as a camp counselor and at McDonalds.  MOB reports FOB does not have any other children and that he's very involved and supportive.  She reports he's employed at [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] and helps her financially.  She reports she, FOB, and her family have made all purchases for newborn, including a bassinet, clothes, diapers, and car seat.  MOB reports she has already made a pediatric appointment and plans to have newborn followed at Premier Pediatrics.                   MOB reports she is excited to parent newborn and that this was a very desired pregnancy.  MOB reports feeling bonded to newborn and reports her plans to pump and breast feed, but will bottle feed to supplement.  When asked, MOB reports she is aware of how to pump and how to put the pump together.  Nursing has noted concerns related to MOB's ability to feed newborn without prompts, as well as providing misinformation about how much she had fed the baby.  MOB indicted to social work how often and how much to feed newborn and reported her last feeding and when the next feeding is expected.  MOB reports she has fed newborn, but reports FOB ""feeds him best.""  MOB reports she has changed newborn diapers, but reports FOB and family have initiated more ""so I can rest.""  MOB was encouraged to actively participate in newborn care so she can practice, learn, and ask questions while support staff is present.  Throughout this assessment, MOB appeared relaxed, open, honest and forthcoming.  At the end of this assessment, MOB was observed with the baby after he returned from a procedure.  He initially appeared inconsolable and social work offered some ideas for MOB that might make him comfortable, which MOB immediately attempted; baby responded well.  MOB reported feeling ""nervous"" and appeared insecure while soothing the baby.  Social work offered encouragement, because although MOB did not appear confident, she appeared soothing and loving with newborn.    The following day, and just prior to discharge, social work met again with MOB while FOB and her mother were at bedside. They actively participated in this assessment with MOB's permission.  FOB was holding newborn throughout this meeting.  He appeared confident, discussed newborn feeds, and discussed what he learned from meeting the occupation therapist just prior to social work arrival.  MOB appeared attentive to newborn and also discussed some tips and techniques she learned from the occupational therapist.  FOB reports either he or maternal grandmother will be home with MOB to provide support.  He reports he works from 3pm-11pm at [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] and will be able to come home if necessary and indicated MOB will never be alone.  FOB was observed to be supportive of MOB and very involved with newborn.  He reports he has no children, but ""helped raise my 2 nephews.""             Discussed Healthy Start referral and family was very amenable; referral has been placed.  Educated family on signs and symptoms of post partum depression, Shaken Baby Syndrome, and Back to Sleep.  MOB adamant she has no plans to bed-share with newborn, as she indicated ""it's very unsafe.""  Answered parents appropriate questions.

"Assessment: Pt feels breastfeeding is going better than on the first day.  Expresses concern re: not knowing if she should pump or not. Infant using 20 mm nipple shield to assist with latch due to pt having flatter nipples, per pt. LC on first dol noted uncoridinated suck as well. Infant at 91.6% of birth weight this morning, currently infant is feeding on right breast in cross cradle position with nipple shield in place. Mother states infant feeding hurts sometimes, and other times is very comfortable. Both parents report they have been able to hear infant swallowing while feeding. Voiding and stooling as expected.  Breasts are soft, round, no identified risk factors for decreased milk supply.  Nipples are intact, everted, short, elastic areola easily gathered.  Pt taught how to hand express her breasts, and large drops of colostrum noted bilaterally.   Intervention: Infant unlatched, drops of colostrum present in shield, infant extending tongue well, no evidence of restriction. Infant suck on gloved finger reveals clamping of jaws at initial latch, and intermittent chomping with no relation to suck bursts. Occassional posterior humping of tongue. With permission, infant re-latched to right bare breast, able to latch and suck in bursts with visible/audible swallowing occasionally. Difficult to assess due to infant biting down and frequently pushing off of breat, turning head away. Repositioned to right breast in biological nurturing position, with same result - after several attempts did feed for approximately 5 minutes in bursts. Continued to fuss and arch/flex torso, offered burp, swaddled and re-latched in biologic position - able to feed more calmly for several minutes with audible swallowing. Started crying again, offered burp, then to left breast in modified clutch hold with infant ""sitting up"" to nurse, continuing to bite down intermittently - applied nipple shield with infant latching well. Showed parents how to identify swallowing. Nursed for several minutes before falling asleep. Colostrum visible in shield.  Discussed importance of asymmetrical, chin-led latch, as well as allowing infant to determine feeding times by observing infant for feeding cues.  Instructed to allow infant to finish on one breast, using breast compressions to maximize feeding time before switching to second breast at each feeding.  Reviewed nipple care, typical cluster feeding behavior, infant stomach capacity and expected output for infant.  Also discussed managing possible milk oversupply during milk onset. Discouraged use of pacifiers until breastfeeding is well-established, around 3-4 weeks of age. Encouraged maximizing skin to skin time with infant over the next several days as well.   We discussed adding some pumping/hand expression after feeds to collect small amounts of expressed breast milk to offer infant via spoon when too fussy/hungry to calm and latch to breast, and as a supplement after feeding session - parents open to this, and have already been doing this the last 24 hours. Also encouraged to be vigilant for very early hunger signs to make initial latch easier.  Peds team entered room for evaluation of infant at this time - aware of infant weight loss, plan to discharge home today with f/u Monday. Made them aware of concerns with infant suck behavior, and reassured mother's milk supply adequate.  Pt has a copy of the [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] Breastfeeding book and made aware of resources available to her after discharge.

Liveborn infant male weighing 2090 grams with Apgars of 2, 6 and 8.  SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY: Placenta  INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 20 y.o. y.o. female para 0010 at 37 weeks 2 days gestational age who presented for induction after being diagnosed with severe range blood pressures and IUGR. She progressed to 5/C/-1. However, given recurrent prolonged variable decelerations the decision was made to proced wtih cesarean delivery. In the operating room, a level was unable to be obtained off her epidural and the decision was made to proceed with cesarean delivery under general anesthesia.    DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table. A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed. An adequate level was unable to be obtained with regional anesthesia. Given the concerning fetal heart rate tracing, the decision was made to proceed with emergent cesarean delivery under general anestheisa.  Once adequate general anesthesia was obtained, the abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfannenstiel incision. The subcutaneous tissue was incised to the fascia using the scalpel. The fascia was scored with a scalpel. The fascial incision was extended bilaterally with traction. The peritoneum was entered bluntly and then the incision was extended with traction.  A bladder flap was not created. A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended with traction.  The amniotic fluid was clear. The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation. The cord was milked and then doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood were obtained for analysis. The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap. The uterine incision was closed in two layers, the first a running suture of 0 Vicryl and the second a running, imbricating suture of 0 Vicryl.   Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision. The posterior cul de sac and bilateral gutters were irrigated. Hemostasis was achieved in the subfascial area. The fascia was closed two running sutures of 0 Vicryl starting at each angle and meeting at the midline. The subcutaneous tissue was closed with a running suture of 0 chromic. The skin was closed with a running subcuticular closure of 3-0 Monocryl. Dermabond was applied to the incision and then covered with a bioguard dressing. The vagina was cleared of clots. All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.  Complications: none  [**NAME**], MD",0

Liveborn infant female weighing 4224 grams with Apgars of 2, 6, and 8  SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY:  Placenta  INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 28 y.o. female para 1011 who presented to L&D for scheduled induction of labor in setting of prior cesarean section x 1.  Patient strongly desired trial of labor after cesarean section.  Patient progressed to 6 cm and then had recurrent variable decelerations therefore was taken to the operating room for repeat cesarean section.  DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.  The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfannenstiel incision.  A bladder flap was created.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended with traction.  The amniotic fluid was clear.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood were obtained for analysis.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.  The uterus was exteriorized.  The R and L corners were tied with 0-vicryl.  The R corner required additional reapproximation with a figure of eight of monocryl.  The uterine incision was then closed in a running suture of 0 monocryl.  The right corner serosa was reapproximated with 0-chromic.  The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity.  Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision and in the subfascial area.  Surgisnow was placed over the hysterotomy.  The fascia was closed with a single running suture of 0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with a running subcuticular closure of 3-0 Monocryl.  Dermabond was applied to the incision.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.  [**NAME**], MD OB/GYN PGY2",0

MOB confirmed that she did not receive prenatal care, advising that she had attempted to obtain an abortion when she was approximately five months pregnant. She further stated that she had not been able to undergo the procedure due to her advanced stage of pregnancy. When this writer inquired about MOB's lack of prenatal care following her discovery that she would not be able to obtain an abortion, MOB replied, ""they told me I was going to have a boy, but I wound up having a girl. All of the baby stuff I have is for boys."" This writer inquired again about the availability of prenatal care and MOB stated, ""no one would touch me because they said I was high risk."" MOB reported that she was not given a referral to a high risk OB clinic until approximately one week ago. MOB was unable to recall who eventually advised her to seek prenatal care through [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**], stating, ""It was somebody on the phone. It may have been someone from MIC.""  MOB reported that she began using oxycodone approximately two years ago for the treatment of a bulging disk. MOB stated that she received the medication through ""pain management in Tampa."" MOB was unable to recall the name of her physician. MOB reported that her pain management physician stopped treating her due to her pregnancy. She further advised that she ""stopped taking the pills altogether,"" but later stated that she had decreased her dosage to approximately 15 mg every other day. MOB stated that she had decided to decrease her oxycodone use, but not stop altogether, based on the recommendation of ""a doctor my mom talked to."" MOB reported that her pain management physician had also prescribed Valium while she was receiving treatment at the clinic, stating that she'd still had some left form her last prescription.   MOB denied any history of DCF involvement. This writer advised MOB that, due to concerns for newborn safety, an abuse report would be filed with the Department of Children and Families. Anticipatory guidance was provided and MOB was encouraged to contact social work as needed. An abuse report was filed and accepted by the FL Abuse Hotline ([**CONTACT_PHONE**]-ABUSE).

Liveborn infant A, female weighing 1840 grams with Apgars of 8 and 9.  Liveborn infant B, female weighing 1035 grams with Apgars of 1, 1, and 3 at 1, 5, and 10 minutes.    Indication: [**NAME**] is a 34 y.o. female para 0 @ 32 weeks with mono-di twins versus di-di twins who has IUGR twin B, BPP 6/10 on two separate occasions, 2 off for NST and breathing.  Given nonreassuring testing on repetitive tests, patient was taken to the operating room for primary cesarean.  Although patient was cephalic, cephalic, patient opted for primary cesarean delivery to not stress baby B.  Procedure: After satisfactory anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped in a routine fashion for abdominal surgery.  Time-out confirmed patient and procedure.  The abdomen was entered with a Pfannenstiel approach.  A bladder flap was created and then a transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and extended laterally with the surgeons fingers.  Amniotic fluid was clear.  The above described infant A was delivered from the Cephalic presentation.  The above described infant B was delivered from the Cephalic presentation soon after the delivery of the first twin. The cords were clamped and cut and the babies were handed to the pediatrician.  Blood for gases and DNA was obtained.   The placenta was delivered with cord traction.  The uterus was wiped out with a lap.  The uterus was closed in a double layer closure using 0-vicryl for the first layer and 0-Monocryl for the second layer.  Additional sutures of 2-0 vicryl and 0-monocryl were placed for added hemostasis.  2 amps of methergine were given IM and the uterus was still boggy.  The patient was frog legged to assure that vaginal bleeding was minimal after closure of the uterus.  Bleeding was minimal but an additional 0.2 mg of methergine was given intrauterine.    The peritoneum was reapproximated using a running suture of 2-0 vicryl. The same suture was then used to reapproximate the rectus muscles in a running stitch.  The fascia was closed with 2 sutures of 0-Vicryl starting at each angle, running in a continuous fashion, and meeting in the middle. The subcutaneous tissue was closed using a running suture of 3-0 vicryl. The skin was closed with a running subcuticular suture of 3-0 monocryl. Steristrips and bandage was applied. The vagina was cleared of clots. All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.  [**NAME**]  Dictated for Dr. [**NAME**]",0

"Anesthesia Note.  25 yo female G1P0 on active labor, requested epidural for labor analgesia. Epidural placement performed in standard fashion, LOR @ 6cm, no CSF obtained initially, however with advancement of epidural catheter and during administration of test dose, a small amount of fluid was aspirated. I administered 2cc of lidocaine 2% with epinephrine 5mcg/mL, with relatively fast onset of numbness and motor block. Dr. [**NAME**] (AOD) notified of intrathecal catheter. CSF was aspirated from the catheter, confirming it was indeed intrathecal. VS remained stable, and no bolus dose was given. Pt is comfortable, catheter has been labeled with pink ""continuous spinal"" labels, nursing staff has been notified, and spinal infusion is being held until block from intrathecal lidocaine begins to resolve.  Plan: - Monitor patient closely. Since only lidocaine was given, expect block to start to wear within an hour.  - Nursing staff aware of catheter being intrathecal and infusion not running until block is less dense. - Will administer cosyntropin 1mg after delivery to decrease risk of PDPHA. - Patient was explained about continuous spinal, she voiced understanding of the situation and agrees with therapy. - Catheter to be pulled by anesthesia provider after delivery. - Call anesthesia if there is need for further analgesia.",1

Low transverse cesarean incision made on the uterus without extensions. Viable female, with Apgars of 8 and 9, weight of 2771 grams.  DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  The patient was seen in the Preoperative Holding Area.  Informed consent was reviewed.  History and physical was confirmed.  The patient was brought to the Operating Room and placed supine on the operating table with spinal anesthesia in place.  She was prepped and draped with an indwelling Foley.  A time-out procedure was observed confirming patient, position and procedure as well as special equipment.  A Pfannenstiel incision was made excising the old scar and carried down through the subcutaneous tissue through the fascia and into the peritoneum.  Upon entering the peritoneum, the bladder flap was developed and a transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment and extended with blunt dissection.  An amniotomy was performed.  Clear fluid was identified.  The infant was in the occiput posterior position.  The infant was delivered with assistance of the physician's hand.  The oropharynx was suctioned, nares were suctioned, the cord was clamped, and the baby was then passed to the NICU Team where a blood sample was obtained.  The placenta was then delivered spontaneously.  The uterus then curetted with a moist lap sponge.  The uterus was then closed in a running locked fashion using 0-Monocryl.  A second layer of 0-Monocryl was used to imbricate the primary layer. With hemostasis well controlled, the needle, instrument, and sponge counts correct, the uterus was returned to the abdominal cavity.  The peritoneum was then closed in a running fashion using 2-0 Vicryl.  The rectus muscles were approximated in the midline using 2-0 Vicryl.  The fascia was closed starting at the angles and meeting in the midline using 0-Vicryl used in an interrupted fashion to reinforce the primary layers.

"Pt has progressed to 5-6 cm but after restarting Magnesium is contracting less Indications for cesarean re-reviewed: Pt had h/o HSV, last lesions were ""years ago"", but she reported some perineal tingling that she says was NOT characteristic of a her prodrome the morning after admission, thus acyclovir was started.  Her symptoms have not progressed and no lesions have occurred.  The recommendation from MFM was for cesarean delivery for PTL to avoid the risk of neonatal HSV transmission.  Because we want to avoid iatrogenically earlier delivery via cesarean in attempts to avoid SVD, it seemed appropriate to reconsider our concern for neonatal transmission in the setting of atypical possible prodromal symptoms of recurrent herpes lesions with no active lesions s/p 3 days of acyclovir.  Drs. Duff and Egerman confirmed their recommendation for cesarean delivery for further PTD.  Dr. [**NAME**] offered 7cm as an example of an unstable cervical exam at which point we could proceed with cesarean without much concern that we were giving up further gestational age.  Dr. [**NAME**] thought that after 5-7 days of acyclovir without emergence of leions, the prodrome could be considered treated to the point that vaginal delivery could be reconsidered.  KDavidsonMD",0

Disposition: stable  Operative Report and Findings: The patient was taken to the operating room and there under Spinal anesthesia her abdomen was draped and prepped in the usual sterile fashion.  A Mildline incision was made around the previous old scar and the  Old scar was removed with sharp dissection.  The various anatomical layers were then dissected down to the layer of the parietal peritoneum.The parietal peritoneum was entered with aid of hemostats and Metzenbaum scissors. The uterus was adhered to the anterior abdominal wall and had to be resected with sharp and blunt dissection.  Once the uterus was freed from the anterior wall a  bladder flap was established with aid of Metzenbaum scissors.  A transverse incision was made on the lower uterine segment and spread with blunt finger dissection.  A viable male infant was delivered  and handed to the NICU unit on standby.  The placenta was manually removed and the uterus was closed with a continuous interlocking layer of 0-PDS suture.  The uterine incision was then reinforced with a second continuous imbricating layer of 0-PDS.  The parietal peritoneum was then closed with a continuous layer of 000-vicryl.    The fascia was closed with a continuous layer of 0-PDS starting a suture from both corners of the incision.  The fascia was reinforced with 3 smeed-jones type interupted sutures at the mid, upper and lower part of the longtutional incision.  The subcutaneous layer was closed with a continuous layer of 000-vicryl. The skin was closed with a subcuticular stitch of 0000-proline suture.  The incision was covered with a Derma bond dressing.

She was started on Magnesium for seizure prophylaxis prior to transfer which was continued upon arrival to STH.  A misoprostol induction of labor was begun.  The patient received 4 doses of misprostol.  She then developed severe range blood pressures that were refractory to treatment with IV anti-hypertensives, and as she was remote from delivery, the decision was made to proceed with urgent cesarean delivery. She underwent primary low transverse cesarean delivery without complication.  Her post-operative recovery was unremarkable, and by post-operative day 3, she had met all criteria for discharge home.  Her blood pressure had normalized and her platelets were trending upward.  She strongly desired discharge home.  Follow-up with WHG in 1-2 weeks  [**NAME**] [**DATE**] 10:18 AM",0

The peritoneal cavity then was entered without complication through a  Pfannensteil incision.  The lower uterine segment was identified, and the bladder flap was created by sharp and blunt dissection.  A horizontal incision was made in the lower uterine segment, and the infant was delivered from a cephalic presentation without difficulty.  The baby was a  3 pound, 2 ounce female and had Apgar scores of 9 and 10 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively.  The arterial and venous cord blood gases are pending at this time. The placenta was removed by gentle traction on the umbilical cord.  It was intact, and the cord had 3 vessels.  The myometrium then was closed in two layers using continuous sutures of 0-Vicryl.  The pericolic gutters were carefully irrigated.  The fascial edges then were re-approximated with two continuous sutures of 0-Vicryl.  The wound was  irrigated, and the lower half of the subcutaneous tissue was re-approximated with a running suture of 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin edges were re-approximated with an intracuticular suture of 3-0 Monocryl.  The estimated blood loss during surgery was 800 ml, and the patient received 700 ml of lactated ringer's solution.  At the conclusion of the procedure, the sponge count and needle count were correct.  The neonate was transported to the newborn nursery in good condition, and the mother was transported to the recovery room, also in good condition.  The patient received an injection of cefazolin plus azithromycin to reduce the risk of postoperative infection.  [**NAME**], M.D. Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology",1

Pomeroy BTI   Surgeon: [**NAME**]  Assistant: [**NAME**] MS IV  Anesthesiologist Gravenstein  Anesthesia: Epidural   Procedure:   Prior to the start of surgery, a time-out was taken, and the patient's identity and operative procedure were verified.  The peritoneal cavity then was entered without complication through the patient's previous Pfannensteil incision.  The lower uterine segment was identified, and the bladder flap was created by sharp and blunt dissection.  A horizontal incision was made in the lower uterine segment, and the infant was delivered from a cephalic presentation without difficulty.  The baby was a  3799 gram  female and had Apgar scores of 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively.  The  venous cord blood gas was 7.32. The arterial cord blood gas was not obtained. The placenta was removed by gentle traction on the umbilical cord.  It was intact, and the cord had 3 vessels.  The myometrium then was closed in two layers using continuous sutures of 0-Vicryl.  The pericolic gutters were carefully irrigated.  The fascial edges then were re-approximated with two continuous sutures of 0-Vicryl.  The wound was  irrigated, and the lower half of the subcutaneous tissue was re-approximated with a running suture of 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin edges were re-approximated with an intracuticular suture of 3-0 Monocryl.  The estimated blood loss during surgery was 800 ml, and the patient received 1800 ml of lactated ringer's solution.  At the conclusion of the procedure, the sponge count and needle count were correct.  The neonate was transported to the newborn nursery in good condition, and the mother was transported to the recovery room, also in good condition.  The patient received an injection of cefazolin plus azithromycin to reduce the risk of postoperative infection.  [**NAME**], M.D. Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology",1

Pressures have been mild range, UOP adequate, DTR 2+ bilaterally.  Patient asymptomatic.    Discussed reassuring cervical change with misoprostol x 4 and the fact that she is progressing as expected.   The next step is to start pitocin.  If she does not make progress, will reassess and discuss.  Discussed the fact that SVD better for her and promotion of healing and recovery.  The fact that she has had one vaginal delivery before (of a larger baby) after induction from an unfavorable cervix is very reassuring and makes it more likely she will have a successful induction now.   Patient currently doing well at [**DATE**].  Patient and FOB agree to start pitocin to continue induction at this time. All questions answered.

The patient appears to be contracting approximately every 10 minutes. The FHT is currently baseline 170s, moderate BTBV, positive accels, when the pateint was first put on the monitor the FHT was in the 80's c/w a variable decel. The maternal HR is in the 120s.

"Called regarding patient well known to the neurosurgery service.  Ms. [**NAME**] is a very pleasant 25 yo female with known posterior cervical hemangioma. Patient is currently in her 3rd trimester of pregnancy. She remains asymptomatic at rest. On exam she has symmetric motor exam with 5/5 strength and intact sensation. However upon valsalva patient develops symptoms of bilateral lower extremity numbness and posterior lumbar spine and lower extremity paresthesias consistent with Lhermitte's phenomenon. Because of the onset of the symptoms with minimal straining, this suggests that normal child labor would increase risk of spinal cord injury when compared to a cesarean section.   Discussed with patient and primary team. Will discuss risks of both to the patient. In either case would strongly recommend avoiding hypotension during delivery and perform physical/neurologic exam after delivery.   IF patient does develop any symptoms that persist please notify neurosurgery on call emergently.

"ATTENDING DELIVERY NOTE AND SUBSEQUENT OP NOTE  At 0800, the patient was 70%, 3to4 cm,and -3 station.  Pitocin induction was started. At 1035, I returned to evaluate the patient.  She was sittiing upright having an epidural catheter inserted.  However, she was visibly uncomfortable and stated that she felt like she had to push.  I quickly examined her and noted that she was C/C. +3 cm  The attempt to place the epidural was discontinued..  Within 5 minutes, she spontaneously delivered a 3543 gram female with no anesthesia.  The baby had Apgar scores of [**DATE**].  The arterial cord pH was 7.26.  Although the patient had several small gushes of blood, the placenta did not separate.  Gentle traction on the cord was unsuccessful in dislodging the placenta.  The blood loss associated with the delivery itself was 300 ml.  However, the retained placenta resulted in continuing slow blood loss.  Accordingly, I quickly counseled the patient for manual removal of the placenta in the OR under general anesthesia.  She readily agreed to the procedure, but the urgency of the situation did not allow time for her to sign an operative consent form.  Dr. [**NAME**] was consulted for assistance.  OPERATIVE NOTE  Preoperative Diagnosis:  Retained (adherent) placenta  Postoperative DIagnosis:  1.  Retained (adherent)  placenta 2. Small 1.5 cm laceration at the vaginal introitus  Procedure: 1. Manual removal of the placenta 2.  Repair of perineal laceration  Surgeon:  [**NAME**]  Anesthesiologist:  [**NAME**]  Anesthesia:  Intravenous ketamine  Description of the Procedure:  Prior to the start of surgery, a time-out was taken,and the patient's identity and surgical procedure were verified.  Under ketamine anesthesia, she was placed in the dorsal lithotomy position and draped in a sterile manner.  Within 1 minute, I was able to manually remove the placenta.  I then performed a limited uterine curettage to be certain that all fragments of placenta were removed.  I then performed an abdominal ultrasound to verify that no significant amount of placental tissue remained in the uterine cavity.  From the time the adherent placenta was diagnosed until it was removed, the patient lost approximately 1000 ml of blood.  The received 1000 ml of LR solution during surgery.  She also received an injection of cefazolin, 1 gram, to reduce the risk of infection following manual removal of the placenta.  The patient was awakened from anesthesia without difficulty and transported back to her labor room in good condition.  Her blood pressure remained normal during surgery. Her pre-operative HCT was 40 vol %.  [**NAME**], M.D.",0

[**NAME**], MD ASSISTANT SURGEON:  [**NAME**], MD and [**NAME**], MD  ANESTHESIOLOGIST:   ASSISTANT ANESTHESIOLOGIST:    ANESTHESIA:  Spinal and general endotracheal anesthesia.  ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  800 mL.  IV FLUIDS:  2000 mL.  PATHOLOGY:  Segments of each tube.  FINDINGS:   1.Live male newborn, weight 3210 g, Apgars 5 and 9. 2.Normal tube and ovaries. 3.Extensive external decidual reaction in the posterior side of the uterus that extended into the rectal serosa. 4.Small uterine fibroids, about 1-2 cm diameter.  DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE:  The patient was identified and brought to the Operating Room, and was placed on the operating table in dorsal supine position.  A time-out confirmed patient and procedure.  It was verified that the patient received prophylactic antibiotics and SCDs were in place.  After placement of proper spinal anesthesia, a Pfannenstiel incision was performed.  Then a low transverse incision in the uterine segment was performed with the delivery via breach of a male newborn above-described.  The placenta was delivered through cord traction.  The uterus was wiped out with a lap.  The uterus was exteriorized.  The tube was identified by its fimbriated end.  It was grasped using a Babcock clamp.  A small opening was performed on the mesosalpinx and, using 0 chromic suture, the tubes were tied.  Then the intervening segment was cut and excised bilaterally.  Hemostasis was assured.  At this time we identified the extensive decidual reaction above described in the posterior wall of the uterus.  This decidual reaction was having bleeding.  Initially it was attempted to produce hemostasis to compression.  This was not successful, so this was achieved later using cautery and figure-of-eight stitches in appropriate places.  During this period, the uterus became soft, so the patient received IM Hemabate 2 times, 250 mcg, and Methergine 0.2 mg IM as well, and later misoprostol 1000 mg per rectum.  The bleeding continued in the posterior wall of the uterus.  We applied compression using a warm wet lap for about 10 minutes.  This improved considerably the bleeding to the extent that it was minimal.  We applied Arista and on top of it Surgicel.  This controlled definitely the bleeding.  After 10 minutes, it  was verified that there was no more bleeding.  In order to return the uterus to the intra-abdominal position, it was decided to produce a small vertical extension open on the fascia as well as on the right abdominis rectus muscle.  This was performed without complications, and the uterus was replaced into the abdominal cavity.  Hemostasis was assured.  The muscle was sutured with 3-0 Vicryl.  The fascia was closed with running suture of 0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissue was closed using 3-0 Vicryl in interrupted manner, and the skin was closed using 4-0 Vicryl in a subcuticular running stitch.

She progressed to 5cm but remained unchanged for over 4 hours despite high doses of pitocin. She then began to have recurrent variable decelerations on FHT and decision was made to proceed with cesarean delivery.  Procedure: After satisfactory anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped in a routine fashion for abdominal surgery.  Time-out confirmed patient and procedure.  The abdomen was entered with a Pfannesteil approach.  A bladder flap was created and then a transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and extended laterally with surgeon's fingers.  Amniotic fluid was clear.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation.  The cord was clamped and cut and the baby handed to the pediatrician.  Blood for gases and DNA was obtained.  The placenta was delivered with cord traction.  The uterus was wiped out with a lap.  The uterus was closed in a double layer closure using 0-vicryl.  The fascia was closed with 1 suture/s of 0-Vicryl starting at the angle and running in a continuous fashion. The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated saline.  The skin was closed with 4-0 polysorb.

This EEG is being performed to evaluate for possible seizures.  TECHNICAL SUMMARY:  This is a prolonged 1 hour and 30 minute study performed at the patient's bedside utilizing a 21 channel digital system with the patient in the awake and drowsy states.  A standard set of electrodes were applied according to International 10-20 guidelines with dual lead EKG recording simultaneous cardiac rhythm.  In the awake state with eyes closed, the patient demonstrates a well-developed and modulated 9 to 10 Hz posterior predominant rhythm that attenuates with eye opening and drowsy transitions.  No evidence of sleep was seen on this record.  The patient was supposed to go on prolonged monitoring, however, during her  epidural the equipment was disconnected. Episodic bilateral temporoparietal delta frequency slowing is seen.  At times, associated with transitions between wakefulness and drowsiness.  No definitive epileptiform features or subclinical seizure activity was seen. The EKG appears to show tachycardia throughout.  IMPRESSION:  Prolonged video EEG remarkable for episodic bilateral temporoparietal mild slowing, likely related to the patient's  drowsiness. No evidence of definitive epileptiform features or subclinical seizure activity was seen.  The consulting team was notified of these results.  The patient was taken off of monitoring urgently to go to C-section.

Incompetent cervix with advanced cervical dilation and prolapsing membranes  DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  1. Postpartum   MAJOR PROCEDURES PERFORMED: 1. Intravenous Ampicillin, Azithromycin, Gentamicin, and Metronidazole 2. Emergency MacDonald Rescue Cerclage 3. Misoprostol Induction of Labor at 20 weeks gestation 4. Vaginal delivery  SUMMARY: [**NAME**] is a 33 y.o.  female P 0-0-1-0, presenting with a 19 week intrauterine pregnancy with vaginal bleeding.  On admission she was found to be dilated to 3 centimeters with 30 percent effacement and bulging membranes.  Amniotic fluid index was 13.1 at the time.  For full history of present illness please see complete history and physical exam. She was admitted on hospital day one and was started on ampicillin and azithromycin intravenously for exposed membranes.  She was evaluated by Maternal Fetal Medicine and on hospital day three underwent an emergency MacDonald cerclage, and she was started on gentamicin and metronidazole.  For details please see the dictated operative note.  She tolerated the procedure well without incident.  She was transferred to the floor, where she remained stable until hospital day seven when she reported leaking of fluid.  Speculum exam was equivocal with a positive nitrazine but negative fern test, however ultrasound revealed new anhydramnios.  The patient was counseled regarding her options, and she decided to terminate the pregnancy.  Consents were signed and witnessed.  Her cerclage was removed and a misoprostol induction of labor was begun.  On hospital day eight she delivered a live 20 week fetus which subsequently died.  Her placenta delivered spontaneously and complete delivery was confirmed on ultrasound.  She declined autopsy or cremation.  She was ambulating, voiding spontaneously and tolerating a regular diet.  She was then discharged home in good condition.    DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: You may immediately resume your usual diet. You may take a shower or a bath, according to your preference.

Time-out confirmed patient and procedure.  The abdomen was entered with a Pfannenstiel approach.  The rectus muscle was dissected from the anterior rectus fascia with Mayo scissors and electrocautery.  On entry into the abdominal cavity multiple adhesions were noted among the omentum, the uterus, and the anterior abdominal wall.  The adhesions were dissected from the anterior abdominal wall and in two places was clamped, separated and ligated with 2-0 Chromic Gut suture.  A bladder flap was created and then a transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and extended laterally with the surgeon's fingers.  Amniotic fluid was clear.

The placenta was delivered with cord traction.  The uterus was wiped out with a lap.  The uterus was closed in a single layer closure using 0-Vicryl.  The bladder flap was inspected and hemostasis was assured.  The peritoneum was re-approximated with 2-0 Chromic suture in a running fashion.  The fascia was closed with 2 sutures of 0-Vicryl starting at the angles and running in a continuous fashion, meeting in the middle. The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated with saline and re-approximated with 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with 3-0 Monocryl in a subcuticular fashion.

"[**DATE**]  Congenital Heart Center Fetal Cardiac Program Inpatient Consult Note  Reason for consult: Known unbalanced AV canal in fetus, with maternal PPROM. Requesting physician: [**NAME**]  HPI: [**NAME**] is a 29 year old female G3P0202 who is currently ~ 31 weeks GA. EDC [**DATE**]. She was transferred from Dr. [**NAME**] at [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] Medical Group in [**LOCATION_CITY**] for PPROM on [**DATE**]. She was receiving prenatal care from Dr. [**NAME**] also from [**LOCATION_CITY**], FL and was also seen by Dr. [**NAME**] of Nemours Children's Clinic who did a fetal echocardiogram at 27 weeks GA which showed unbalanced AV canal with right dominance, hypoplastic left heart and aortic valve annulus. She stated that while watching TV the night prior to admission, she felt a trickle of fluid, and it continued to leak while she went to the bathroom. Due to prior history of PPROM in her second child with preterm delivery at 36 weeks, she suspected rupture of membranes and went to the hospital. At [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**], she was confirmed to have PPROM, was given antibiotics, started on Mag, and a dose of steroids. She did not have contractions, though complained of some cramping. Good fetal movement. She reports to have an amniocentesis done which showed normal karyotype. She did not know if microarray was sent.  On her last fetal echocardiogram done by Dr. [**NAME**], [**DATE**], at 27 weeks GA, the fetal cardiac anatomy are as follows: Unbalanced AV canal with right ventricular dominance.  Ostium primum ASD. AV canal type (inlet) VSD. Common AV vlave. Discrepant vessel size (pulmonary artery dominance0. Hypoplastic aortic annulus, mild aortic arch hypoplasia. Moderately hypoplastic left ventricle. Mild RV dilation.   She is currently taking prenatal MVI, progesterone and Zantac. She has no known drug allergies.  Her past medical and surgical history is significant for previous acute cholecystitis S/P cholecystectomy, S/P cervical biopsy, GERD. She denies history of diabetes, hypertension, or heart disease, hepatitis, liver disease, seizure disorder, thyroid disease, renal disease, thromboembolic disease or or pulmonary disease.   Her OB history is as follows:  1st pregnancy [**DATE**] - preterm delivery at 36 weeks GA, healthy baby with no issues. 3033g 2nd pregnancy  [**DATE**] - preterm delivery at 36 weeks GA, 2683 g, otherwise healthy baby with no issues.  Her family history shows that there were heart murmurs in her maternal side of the family.  No other family history of known congenital heart disease, cardiac rhythm disease, nor anyone with pacemakers, no sudden death before the age of 55 years old, no thyroid disease. Maternal Grandmother had distant relatives with possible genetic syndromes. No significant family history from father of the baby.  Her social history shows that she currently works as a veterinary tech. She denies exposure to cat litter during this pregnancy. She is not married. The father of the baby is 32 years old, and is an electrician.  She denies smoking during this pregnancy, recreational drug or NSAID use. She admits to drinking caffeinated beverages during this pregnancy.  A complete 2-D, color, and spectral fetal Doppler echocardiographic study and interpretation was performed at 31 weeks gestational age for history of fetal unbalanced AV canal and hypoplastic aortic valve.  Levocardia. There is situs solitus, four cardiac chambers and crossing of outflow tracts. Complete and possibly mildly unbalanced atrioventricular canal with very mild right dominance. Trivial atrioventricular valve regurgitation with multiple jets. Qualitatively mildly dilated right ventricular size with normal systolic function. In short axis, possibly very mildly hypoplastic left ventricle with normal left ventricular systolic function. Dysplastic and mildly hypoplastic aortic valve annulus with mild flow acceleration across the valve. No aortic valve regurgitation. Low normal ascending aortic dimensions, and mildly hypoplastic aortic isthmus. Patent ductus arteriosus and patent foramen ovale with normal intrauterine right to left flow. No pericardial effusion.  Assessment and Plan: [**NAME**] is a 29 year old, G3P2, 31 weeks GA, PPROM with the above fetal cardiac diagnosis. The above diagnosis and its medical and surgical implications were discussed in detail with Ms. [**NAME**]. The full spectrum of possible outcomes were discussed including the possible need for early surgical repair if there is significant left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. If the left ventricle is adequate, we anticipate biventricular repair. If left ventricle is more hypoplastic at delivery, then 3-stage single ventricle-palliation should be anticipated.  We agree with current obstetric management and possible delivery at 34 weeks GA. Again, depending on the degree of left-sided obstruction (if coarctation of the aorta or significant aortic stenosis is present after delivery), this may be a ductal dependent lesion, and baby will possibly need prostaglandins. The association of complete atrioventricular canal and Trisomy 21 was also discussed. Mother reports that her amniocentesis results were normal.  The findings and limitations of the exam and the limitations of fetal echocardiography in general including the inability to rule out septal defects, anomalies of venous return, coarctation of the aorta and some valvar defects, were discussed with Ms. [**NAME**].  Follow-up fetal echocardiogram in 2 weeks to reassess left ventricular size, aortic annulus and aortic arch size.  I have spent more than 1 hour with this patient in which more than 50% of the time was spent in counseling the patient with th 2 fetal diagnoses, its medical and surgical implications, as well as coordination of care.  Findings communicated with [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] OB and MFM teams, Drs. [**NAME**] and [**NAME**].  Thank you very much for letting us participate in your patient's care. Should you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to call our office.

I evaluated this patient and examined the patient at bedside.  I agree with the above examination and plan of care. The patient remains neurologically stable without clinical or electrical seizures.  Reviewed the radiological images in detail comparing the first MRV in [**DATE**] before craniotomy to the most resent MRV in [**DATE**].  The large deep venous sinuses appear normal and open.  The cortical draining veins change in caliber between each study.  The fist MRV and CTA showed decrease in cortical veins over the right hemisphere.  There was possible stenosis in several left hemispheric veins.  The MRV in [**DATE**] showed an occlusion in the right vein of Trolard which was open previously.  The latest study again shows decreased draining veins on the left.  There is increased right temporal edema on current study compared to [**DATE**].  There is no diffusion abnormality making Lymphoma or arterial stroke unlikely.  The edema may be secondary to venous occlusion vs. Inflammatory process.  Given the unclear diagnosis and the near delivery with a postpartum hypercoagulability opt to initiate anticoagulation.  Will participate in the multidisciplinary meeting on Wednesday.  Post delivery will obtain a contrast MRI before determining subsequent plan.,0

No further social work interventions planned unless otherwise contacted Yes  Comments MOB reports an unplanned, but desired pregnancy.   Social work met bedside with MOB re: recent history of domestic violence.  Please see previous social work services progress note for continuity.  MOB reports she had, until delivery, resided with FOB's mother (PGM).  She reports FOB ""stayed there sometimes"" but that he didn't reside there permanently because he wasn't on the lease and that PGM could ""get in trouble or kicked out"" of the public housing apartment if he/they were caught staying there.  MOB reports the incident that led to current hospitalization and subsequent delivery put PGM's housing at risk and neither are welcome to stay there at this time.  MOB reports she has since moved in with her grandparents.    MOB denies domestic violence (DV) as the cause for her abdominal trauma.  MOB reports she and FOB were ""arguing"" and he went to leave by riding his bike, but MOB reports she tried to stop him and she ""accidentally"" fell over.  MOB denies he intentionally pushed or shoved her.  MOB denies feeling threatened or unsafe at any point during their argument.  MOB reports she did not call the police or EMS, however they both showed up because a family member notified them.  MOB reports immediately following the incident she contacted a family member to take her to the hospital to be checked due to her abdominal trauma.  She reports that family member notified the police.  MOB reports FOB never left the scene, and when police arrived neither she nor FOB wanted to press charges because they didn't believe anything unlawful had occurred.  She reports the police officer didn't arrest either party, but issued a sworn complaint.  MOB continues to deny that FOB has ever hit, hurt, shoved, pushed, or intimidated her in any way.  She denies he restricts her from visiting with friends, family, or financial resources.  MOB disclosed that this pregnancy she was arrested for damaging FOB's vehicle because she was angry with him.  Social work discussed concerns re: their ability to safely care for a newborn given their history.  Discussed risk of Shaken Baby Syndrome and other abuses to a child, as well as the potential for DCF involvement.  MOB reports she has no plans to resume residing with FOB, as she has moved with her grandparents, both of whom are involved and supportive.  MOB reports plans to stay there indefinitely.  MOB was very willing to accept a referral to Healthy Start services, which could help her and FOB develop appropriate parenting skills/techniques.  Discussed appropriate ways to cope with the new stressor of single parenting, as well as recent transition to her family's home, and the on-going issues between her and FOB.  Educated her on DV resources and the cycle of violence, both as the aggressor and the victim.    MOB reports an unplanned, but desired pregnancy.  Discussed her plans for birth control.  MOB was observed providing care for newborn, and appears to be bonding appropriately.  She reports adequate preparations at home, including a car seat, bassinet, clothes, and diapers.  She reports her family is planning to be involved and supportive, and it is expected FOB will be involved to co-parent.  MOB has identified CMS as the facility to follow newborn care.  She reports having acces to transportation, has Medicaid, WIC, and receives Food Stamps.            MOB reports a history of marijuana use prior to the knowledge of her pregnancy.  She denies any substance use this pregnancy and submitted to a urine toxicology screen at delivery that produced negative results.  MOB reports no plans to resume.  MOB reports there are no smokers in home.  Discussed SIDS, Shaken Baby Syndrome, Back to Sleep, and provided booklet, Family Development -- A Caregiver's Guide.

"ATTENDING DISCHARGE SUMMARY:  DOA:  [**DATE**] DOD: [**DATE**]  HOSPITAL COURSE;  The patient was admitted on the evening of [**DATE**] at 37 weeks gestation for evaluation of ""decreased fetal movement.""  NST was initially reactive, but then showed a prolonged deceleration.  Ultrasound showed decreased amniotic fluid.  Induction was begun.  On the afternoon of [**DATE**], the patient developed an arrest of dilation at 5 cm.  The FHR tracing also became non-reassuring --> recurrent severe variable decelerations.  Therefore, an urgent cesarean delivery was performed under general anethesia (the patient's labor epidural was ineffective).  The male baby had normal APGAR scores and normal blood gases.  Interestingly, at the time of surgery, we noted evidence of an occult cord prolapse.  The mother's postoperative course was uncomplicated.  Her postoperative HCT was 31 vol%.  The baby was noted to be ""tongue-tied"" and is scheduled to have the frenulum released prior to discharge today.  DISPOSITION:  1.  The patient is discharged to the care of her husband at home. 2. She was given routine postoperative instructions. 3.  She was given prescriptions for Percocet and ibuprofen. 4.  She will make a decision about contraception when she meets with me at her postoperative appointment.  [**NAME**], MD.",0

[**NAME**] (21y/o) and paternal grandmother, [**NAME**], remained at bedside with MOB's permission.  MOB reports prior to moving to FL she resided in GA with her father and stepmother.  She reports the home was ""tiny,"" didn't have enough room for her and baby, and that GA was not a ""good"" place to raise a family.  MOB reports that FOB resided in the home intermittently when he was able to work and pay rent.  FOB reports when he wasn't residing with MOB, he stayed ""couch surfing"" between 2 friends.    A review of medical records indicates MOB with history of substance abuse.  It should be noted that in doing a review of records, social work did not note a previous urine toxicology screen from MOB's limited PNC, other than the one she submitted to at delivery which revealed negative results.  MOB minimized any history of substance use or misuse, and reported that approximately 3 years ago she experimented with xanax, which was brief and never led to an arrest, substance abuse treatment, or the on-going purchase pills.  MOB denies any substance use or misuse this pregnancy.  FOB denies any substance abuse history.  Parents report they both smoke cigarettes, but do not smoke in the house or in vehicles.  Educated parents re: 2nd and 3rd hand smoke and encouraged hand sanitizing and changing clothes.  Parents decline smoking cessation information at this time.

Parents report they have all necessary infant care items in place, including a crib, bassinet, clothes, diapers, changing table, and bottles.  Parents have been observed providing newborn care in a consistent manner and appear to be responding to newborn cues.  Parents appear to be bonding appropriately.    Parents report they have registered into Medicaid, have chosen a facility for newborn care, have WIC, and are awaiting approval for Food Stamps.  Paternal grandmother reports she is currently supporting parents and newborn with whatever help they need.  Parents have agreed to a Healthy Start referral (in-home parenting support and education program).  Parents report they have their own drivers license and transportation, and deny barriers to pediatric medical care.

Liveborn infant female weighing 3615 grams with Apgars of 9 and 9.  Indication: [**NAME**] is a 39 y.o. female para 8018 who prese  Procedure: After satisfactory anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped in a routine fashion for abdominal surgery.  Time-out confirmed patient and procedure.  The abdomen was entered with a Pfannensteil approach.  A bladder flap was created and then a transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and extended laterally with surgeon's fingers.  Amniotic fluid was clear.  The above described infant was delivered from the oblique/transverse presentation.  The cord was clamped and cut and the baby handed to the pediatrician.  Blood for gases and DNA was obtained.  The placenta was delivered with cord traction.  The uterus was wiped out with a lap.  40 units of pitocin was infused IV following delivery of the placenta, and the patient was given a prophylactic dose of 200 mcg of Methergine IM.  The uterus was closed in a double layer closure using 0-monocryl.    The right fallopian tube was identified by the fimbria, double ligated with 0-chromic suture and the intervening segment excised.  The left fallopian tube was identified by the fimbria, double ligated with 0-chromic suture and the intervening segment excised.  The bladder flap was inspected and hemostasis was achieved with a combination of Bovie cautery and Aristra.  The uterus was firm and had involuted to 2 cm below the umbilicus at time of fascial closer.  The fascia was closed with 2 sutures of 0-Vicryl starting at the angle and running in a continuous fashion. The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and re-approximated with 3-0 vicryl in 2 layers in interrupted fashion.  The skin was closed with 4-0 polysorb.  Steri-strips and a bandage were applied.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  1000 mcg of misoprostol was placed for prophylaxis at the end of the procedure.

She was treated with magnesium for seizure prophylaxis and progressed to C/C/+1. She developed oliguria and increased creatinine to 1.53 with a magnesium level of 9.2. Her magnesium was discontinued and the decision was made to proceed with cesarean delivery due to worsening maternal status.   Procedure: After satisfactory anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped in a routine fashion for abdominal surgery.  Time-out confirmed patient and procedure.  The abdomen was entered with a Pfannensteil approach.  A bladder flap was not created and then a transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and extended laterally with fingers.  Amniotic fluid was clear. A nuchal cord x1 was reduced and the above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation.  The cord was clamped and cut and the baby handed to the pediatrician.  Blood for gases and DNA was obtained.  The placenta was delivered with cord traction.  The uterus was wiped out with a lap.  The uterus was closed in a double layer closure using 0-monocryl. The peritoneum was closed with 3-0 vicryl. The fascia was closed with 1 suture/s of 0-Vicryl starting at the angle and running in a continuous fashion. The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and closed with a running suture of 3-0 vicryl.  The skin was closed with 4-0 polysorb.  Benzoin and steristrips were applied.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.  H [**NAME**] MD",0

MOB reports residing for the last 5 months in a safe and stable home environment with friends who are involved and supportive.  She reports her other children (5y/o, 1y/o) are currently in the ""temporary"" custody of their father because the ""judge is a jerk.""  She reports DCF was involved and she only has supervised visitation with those children.  MOB reports since September she has been enrolled in the outpatient methadone treatment program at Meridian.  MOB would not authorize social work to obtain a copy of the results of her urine toxicology screens from this pregnancy, but did disclose she tested for ETOH 5-7 times.  She reports drinking ""... a beer every now and then because I was constipated.""    It should be noted that MOB has requested multiple times to be off the unit to smoke or get sodas.  She has asked the charge nurse, bedside nurse, has requested volunteers, and has asked other admitted patients to care for newborn while she goes off the unit to smoke.  She has been observed leaving the newborn unattended for an unknown period of time.    Social work reported concerns to MOB and suggested that DCF would be notified to ensure safe discharge of newborn.  MOB became argumentative and defensive and asked social work to leave.

No further social work interventions planned unless otherwise contacted Yes    Social work met privately with MOB re: history of domestic violence, opioid dependence, DCF, limited PNC, and extramural delivery.    MOB reports residing in a safe and stable home environment with her 4y/o child and FOB (same FOB to both children), Timon Welch.  MOB reports in October he was arrested and charged for battery against her.  She reports her other child did not witness the altercation and DCF did not get involved.  MOB reports she and FOB continue to reside together, and that FOB is currently on probation, has completed court ordered services, such as anger management classes, individual and couples counseling, and has passed routine urine drug screens.  A review of PNC records indicates her OB team was aware of this incident and routinely offered her domestic violence services and education.  MOB continued to report feeling safe and declined services.  When asked today, MOB reports feeling safe, denies that FOB has touched/threatened/intimidated/verbally abused her.  MOB reports the incident in October was the first time he had done anything of that nature.    MOB reports a history of substance abuse that eventually led her to outpatient methadone treatment approximately 4 years ago.  She reports her last baby suffered from severe withdrawal and was hospitalized in the NICU for 19 days.  MOB reports she was also taking other drugs at that time and DCF became became involved, however she never lost custody of her baby and sought appropriate substance abuse treatment instead.  She reports the case has since closed and she continues to have custody of her special needs child.  MOB reports prior to learning of her pregnancy, she sought pain management care with Dr. [**NAME**] at the After Hours Clinic who transitioned her to subutex.  She reports when she learned she was pregnant she remained on that medication because she believed it would be less harmful to her fetus.  MOB reports taking the medication throughout this pregnancy and only as prescribed.  MOB denies any other substance use or misuse.  It should be noted that urine toxicology screen revealed negative results on newborn.        MOB reports an extramural delivery was not related to transportation issues or other barriers to seeking medical care.  She reports she called L&D and reported her contractions and they told her to come to the hospital.  She reports she was packing her bags when she realized the baby was about to come, so FOB immediately called EMS.  MOB reports the person on the phone walked FOB through the safe delivery and then EMS transported them to STH.    MOB reports limited PNC was due to unreliable transportation.  Educated her on Medicaid transportation services, which she reports using several times in the past.  It is not clear why she didn't utilize this service for her PNC, however she denies transportation barriers to pediatric care.  She reports her plans to have newborn followed at CMS, as that is where her other child attends.  MOB reports having all necessary infant care items in place, and appears to be bonding appropriately with newborn.  MOB reports an unplanned, but desired pregnancy.",0

Liveborn infant male weighing 2702 grams with Apgars of 9 and 9. Arterial cord pH 7.24 and venous cord pH 7.31.   Indication: [**NAME**] is a 33 y.o. female para 1011 who presented at 39 weeks for scheduled induction of labor for CHTN, GDM and cholelithiasis with plans for surgery postpartum. Due to an unfavorable cervix she was started on miso/foley induction. The foley came out and she progressed to 5 cm on miso alone. Pitocin was started and she began to have deep variable decelerations with contractions. She ruptured spontaneously with meconium noted. Given nonreassuring fetal tracing that worsened with pitocin administration remote from delivery, decision was made to proceed with cesarean delivery.   Procedure: After satisfactory anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped in a routine fashion for abdominal surgery.  Time-out confirmed patient and procedure.  The abdomen was entered with a Pfannensteil approach.  A bladder flap was not created and then a transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and extended laterally with the surgeon's fingers.  Amniotic fluid was meconium.  The above described infant was delivered from the cephalic presentation.  The cord was clamped and cut and the baby handed to the pediatrician.  Blood for gases and DNA was obtained.  The placenta was delivered with cord traction.  The uterus was wiped out with a lap.  The uterus was closed in a single layer closure using 0-vicryl ran continuously across the hysterotomy in a running, locked fashion.   The right fallopian tube was identified by the fimbria, double ligated with 0-chromic suture and the intervening segment excised.  The left fallopian tube was identified by the fimbria, double ligated with 0-chromic suture and the intervening segment excised.    The fascia was closed with 1 suture of 0-Vicryl starting at the angle and running in a continuous fashion. The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and reapproximated with a running stitch of 3-0 vicryl.  The skin was closed with a running intracuticular stitch of 4-0 monocryl. Dermabond was applied.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.  [**NAME**]  Dictated for: [**NAME**] MD   I was present for the entire case.

"I met with Ms. [**NAME**] regarding the possibility of delivering her baby at 23 weeks. We discussed the extremely poor prognosis for survival of a male infant . Estimated fetal weight undetermined at this point. We discussed possible complications of prematurity including, but not limited to, HMD, IVH, PVL, ROP, NEC, CLD, CP, need for mechanical ventilation,  and death. We discussed the long hospitalizations experienced by survivors. We discussed immediate concerns at delivery, such as  inability to establish airway due to small size and extremely poor prognosis if CPR were required. I explained that at this borderline viable gestation age, we would support her decision for comfort care only, airway management only, or full resuscitation with offer of withdrawal of support if some catastrophe of prematurity became apparent. At the time that I left, she informed me that she did want neonatology present for delivery to assess baby. She expressed that she did not want neonatology to perform CPR or do a chest tube, but reserves the right to change her mind in the delivery room. Thank you for this consult. Please do not hesitate to contact neo on call for further questions or concerns",0

When I came to evaluate the patient she was sitting very calmly on the bed with a friend beside her (someone she has known for years from pediatric adolescent palliative care) and although tearful at times seemed appropriately upset and was cooperative. She denied any suicidal or homicidal thoughts and stated that she felt very safe, just felt she had been wronged by some of the people here. She is very upset by the fact that she thinks she has been misrepresented in medical records portraying her as noncompliant. I told the patient I was very sorry to hear what she is going through and just want to be sure that she is in a safe place mentally right now with everything that she has learned today but that I would not be able to addend her medical record or comment further as I have not been taking care of the patient throughout her stay.

She also reports that her voice/resonance changes and she become hyper-nasal when the Mestinon is wearing off.  This hyper-nasality is a very functional clinical sign that her medication is wearing off and that pt's swallowing has declined and aspiration risk has increased.  Discussed the dose schedule with the RN.  RN reports that the dosing has been timed to be given after meals, and that she has noticed the issues with swallowing and hyper-resonance, and did not realize the relationship between swallowing safety and medication dosing.  The RN f/u'd with pharmacy, and pt's dose schedule has been adjusted to accommodate meal schedule and will now be given 60 minutes before scheduled meals.  Plan:  Continue with Mechanical Soft diet at this time.  Once pt is confident that her mestinon schedule is correct and that her pharyngeal strength has improved sufficiently, then, pt will be ready for upgrade to regular diet.    Speech Therapy will continue to f/u with the patient.  [**NAME**], PhD/CCC-SLP Pager [**CONTACT_PHONE**]",0

"Date of Surgery: [**DATE**]  Preoperative Diagnosis: 30 week pregnancy, fetal bradycardia, maternal thyroid storm , Undesired Fertility  Postoperative Diagnosis: Same  Operation Performed: Low transverse cesarean,  Bilateral Tubal Interruption- Parkland method  Surgeon: [**NAME**], MD  Assistant: [**NAME**], MD  Anesthesia: General  Anesthesiologist: [**NAME**], MD  EBL: 800 ml  IVF:  2400 ml  Pathology: bilateral segments of tube, placenta  Findings: Normal uterus, tubes and ovaries bilaterally.  Liveborn infant male with Apgars of 2, 6,  and 6.  Indication: [**NAME**] is a 27 y.o. female para 1112 who was admitted in the MICU with thyroid storm, tachycardia.  She developed fetal bradycardia in the 80s that did not respond to conservative mgmt and the decision made to proceed with Cesarean. She also desires permanent sterilization and understands that BTI is permanent, not reversible, has a 1% risk of failure and an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy if the BTI fails. She also understands that vasectomy and reversible methods are options.  Procedure: After satisfactory general anesthesia was obtained, the patient was pour prepped and draped in a routine fashion for abdominal surgery.  A time-out was taken to confirm patient and procedure.  The abdomen was entered via a Pfannenstiel incision. A bladder blade was placed. A bladder flap was not created. A low transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment and extended laterally and slightly superiorly.  Amniotic fluid was clear.  The above described infant was delivered atraumatically  from  Cephalic presentation.  The mouth and nose were suctioned, the cord was clamped and cut, and the infant was handed to the waiting pediatrician.  A sample of cord for blood for gases and DNA was obtained.  Cord blood was not collected for donation. The placenta was delivered with gentle cord traction and was sent to path.    The uterus was exteriorized and cleared of all clots. The uterine incision was closed in a running continuous fashion using 0 vicryl in a  single layer.  The right fallopian tube was identified and followed to its fimbriated end. A mid-isthmic section was identified and doubly ligated with 0-chromic suture. The intervening segment excised and sent to pathology. The exact same procedure was then performed on the left fallopian tube. The uterus was replaced into the abdomen and the pelvic gutters were irrigated.  The fascia was closed with 0-Vicryl in a running continuous fashion from either end and meeting in the middle.    The skin was closed in a running subcuticular fashion using 4-0 monocryl followed by application of Dermabond.   All counts were correct and the patient was sent to the recovery room in stable condition.   I was present for the entire surgery.

"PGY4 Note:  Myself and Dr [**NAME**] met with the patient and her husband at bedside. Briefly, she is a 31 yo P1001 at 38w2d whose pregnancy has been complicated by GDM and GBS positive status. Her last pregnancy was complicated by a shoulder dystocia at 40 weeks which was resolved by McRobert's and suprapubic pressure. She was delivered by Dr [**NAME**] at [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**]. Baby had no neurologic deficits. The FOB and patient are not able to relay the amount of time that passed between delivery of the head and resolution of the dystocia, but they are able to articulate that she was never counseled against vaginal delivery in subsequent pregnancies.   She had a growth scan at 37 weeks which showed baby to be 3388 grams (65%ile) on [**DATE**]. Based upon this sono we estimate current EFW at 3800 grams.   We discussed at length the risks of shoulder dystocia with this pregnancy given her history of prior shoulder dystocia and now with GDM. We offered her a primary cesarean given this risk and counseled her extensively that this is our strong recommendation.   She indicated that this topic has been discussed with her primary OB, Dr [**NAME**], and she is aware of the associated risks including hypoxia and potential cerebral palsy, brachial plexus injury, fetal injury, perineal laceration including 3rd and 4th degree tears with possible associated incontinence and pain issues.   At this time we plan to continue with induction of labor per the patient's expressed wishes after extensive counseling. We indicated that she may change her mind at any point in her induction course and we would proceed with cesarean. We also relayed that we would readdress the current plan if we had any indication that her labor course was abnormal such as prolonged active phase or 2nd stage. We emphasized that we would be unwilling to assist the 2nd stage with operative delivery via forceps or vacuum.   At the conclusion of our discussion, all of the patient's questions were answered to her satisfaction.  [**NAME**], MD",0

After cesarean delivery, left fallopian tube, IP ligament and broad ligament were found to have hematomas. Liveborn infant male weighing 2625 grams with Apgars of 5 and 9.  SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY:  INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 29 y.o. female para 4125 who was admitted to labor and delivery at 35 weeks for chest pain and then extended monitoring after falling and hitting her abdomen. The pt's tocometry showed uterine irritability and the pt complained of abdominal pain, but this subsided and FHT was reactive over the course of the evening.  At 0615, the pt returned from using the restroom and nursing was unable to obtain a fetal heart tone. A heart beat could not be seen on ultrasound but fetal movement was noted. The pt was moved to the OR and a normal heart rate was found on repeat ultrasound. It was felt the fetus likely had an episode of bradycardia. Given bradycardia in the setting of recent fall, abdominal pain, and uterine irritability, we proceeded with cesarean delivery.  DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a pfannensteil incision.  A bladder flap was created bluntly.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with the surgeon's fingers.  The amniotic fluid was clear.  The above described infant was delivered from the Breech presentation.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood was obtained for analysis.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.  The uterus was exteriorized, and the uterine incision was closed in 2 layers, the first a running locking suture of 0 Vicryl and the second a running, imbricating suture of 0 Vicryl.  Excellent hemostasis was noted.   Next attention was turned to the tubal ligation. The right fallopian tube was identified by the fimbria, double ligated with #1-plain gut suture and the intervening segment excised.  The left fallopian tube was identified by the fimbria, double ligated with #1 plain gut suture and the intervening segment excised.    It was noted after removing the segment of the left tube, that there was a small defect in the uterine serosa between the round ligament and fallopian tube. This was oversewn with a 3-0 vicryl.    The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity.  Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision. However on re-examination of the left fallopian tube and left infundipular pelvic ligament, the distal portion of the fallopian tube was noted to be forming a large hematoma as was the IP. The uterus was exteriorized. The distal portion of the fallopian tube was removed by progressively clamping, cutting, and tying along the fallopian tube/mesosalping junction. After removal of the tube. The left side of the uterus was again inspected and noted to have an expanding hematoma of the broad ligament and infundibulopelvic ligament. It was felt that given expanding hematoma a hysterectomy was indicated to stop the expansion. At this point the pt was awake. We discussed the situation with the pt. She said she was planning on a hysterectomy later on for abnormal bleeding anyway. The pt was placed under general anesthesia after verbally consenting to hysterectomy.  The right round ligament was transfixion sutured with 0 Vicryl and divided with cautery (for the remainder of the dictation, all suture will be 0 Vicryl unless otherwise stated).  The anterior leaf broad of the broad ligament and the vesicouterine peritoneum on the patient's left side were incised with a combination of cautery and sharp dissection to a point below the uterine incision and broad ligament hematoma, but above the cervix.  The posterior leaf of the broad ligament was incised with cautery and sharp dissection. A defect was made in the posterior leaf of the broad ligament beneath the uteroovarian ligament and the proximal fallopian tube.  The uteroovarian ligament and the proximal fallopian tube were doubly clamped, incised, and doubly ligated; the second suture was a transfixion suture.The right uterine vessels were skeletonized. The right uterine vessels were doubly clamped, divided, and sutured.  The same process was repeated on the right side.    The left round ligament was transfixion sutured with 0 Vicryl and divided with cautery (for the remainder of the dictation, all suture will be 0 Vicryl unless otherwise stated).  The anterior leaf broad of the broad ligament and the vesicouterine peritoneum on the patient's left side were incised with a combination of cautery and sharp dissection to a point below the uterine incision and broad ligament hematoma, but above the cervix.  The posterior leaf of the broad ligament was incised with cautery and sharp dissection. The right uterine vessels were skeletonized. The left uterine vessels were doubly clamped, divided, and sutured.  The same process was repeated on the right side. A defect was made in the posterior leaf of the broad ligament beneath the uteroovarian ligament and the proximal fallopian tube.  The uteroovarian ligament and the proximal fallopian tube were doubly clamped, incised, and doubly ligated; the second suture was a transfixion suture.    The remainder of the bladder was separated from the underlying cervix with blunt dissection. The paracervical tissue was progressively clamped, incised, and ligated to a level below the uterine incision and broad ligament hematoma, but above the cervix.  Heaney clamps were placed across the uterus and the uterus was amputated using a scalpel. The specimen was handed off the surgical field.  Interrupted imbricating stitches of 0-vicryl were used to close the the uterine amputation site. The angles were closed with figure of eight stitches of 0-vicryl. Areas of bleeding were oversewn with figure of eight stitches of 0-vicryl. The pelvis was irrigated. The right ovary, tube and IP were examined and were noted to be intact without evidence of injury of hematoma. The right ureter was identified and was noted to be far away from the cervical stump and any suture material. Hemostasis along the right pelvic side wall was achieved with cautery and Arista. The left IP and ovary were examined. The IP hematoma had decreased slightly in size, however given concern for possible retroperitoneal extension, the decision was made to proceed with left oophorectomy. A defect was made in the posterior leaf of the broad ligament beneath the infundibulopelvic ligament and above the ureter.  The IP ligament was doubly clamped, incised, and doubly ligated; the second suture was a transfixion suture.  The ureter was identified before clamping and cutting the IP ligament. The ureter was also identified at the level of the cervical stump and was noted to be far away from the angles. Inspection of the entire field revealed hemostasis. There was a hematoma in the left retroperitoneum that was stable and becoming smaller. All pedicles were hemostatic as was the cervical stump at the completion. Throughout case there was communication with anesthesia regarding blood loss and patient recieved prbcs and FFP was ordered.    The fascia was closed with one suture of 0-vicryl starting at the angle and running continuously.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and hemostasis was assured.  The subcutaneous tissue was reapproximated with a running stitch of 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with 4-0 polysorb. Benzoin, Steri-Strips, and a sterile dressing were applied to the incision.   . An x-ray was performed that showed no retained instruments of laps. The patient was, awakened from anesthesia, and transferred to the SICU in a stable condition.  All counts were correct at the end of the procedure.  [**NAME**], MD",1

True knot in umbilical cord.  Liveborn infant male weighing 3013 grams with Apgars of 9 and 9.  SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY:  INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 34 y.o. female para 3013 with three prior cesarean deliveries, Hepatitis C, and undesired fertility. She presented to Labor and Delivery for a scheduled repeat cesarean and bilateral tubal interruption.  DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfannensteil incision. The incision was taken down to the level of the fascia which was incised in the midline. The incision was extended laterally in either direction over the rectus muscles. The fascia was dissected off the rectus muscle superiorly and then inferiorly. The rectus muscle was divided bluntly. The peritoneum was entered in a clear space sharply. Omental adhesions were lysed with electrocautery. A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with the surgeon's fingers.  The amniotic fluid was clear.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord blood was obtained for infant identification purposes.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.  The uterus was exteriorized, and the uterine incision was closed in two layers, the first a running suture of 0 Vicryl and the second a running, imbricating suture of 0 Vicryl.   The left fallopian tube was identified to its fimbriated end. A Babcock forcep was placed in the midisthmic portion of the left fallopain tube over a relatively avascular portion of the mesosalpinx. A defect was created bluntly in this area of the mesosalpinx with a hemostat. A portion of the tube was ligated on two sutures of plain gut and the intervening portion of tube was excised with Metzenbaum scissors. The portion of tube was handed off the field and prepared to be sent to Pathology. Hemostasis was ensured at the cut ends of the tube. The same procedure was repeated on the right side.  The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity.  Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision, posterior to the bladder, and in the subfascial area.  The closed uterine incision was irrigated. The fascia was closed with two sutures of 0 Vicryl beginning from either end of the incision and meeting in the midportion.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated. The skin was closed with staples.  A sterile dressing was applied to the incision.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.  [**NAME**], MD",0

MOB presented as unguarded, open and honest with information.  A review of medical records indicates MOB with a history of Baker and Marchment Acts (one time each, most recent one year ago).  MOB reports she experienced an unstable life as a child, suffered physical and sexual abuse, and recently experienced the death of her mother.  She reports she was acting out her pain by experimenting with drugs and participating in gang related activity.  MOB reports due to her unstable childhood she also struggled with depression and has previously participated in counseling and was prescribed medications.  She reports she discontinued medication with this pregnancy and reports she experienced a mostly stable mood and denies SI or HI.  MOB reports her support is primarily FOB ([**NAME**] -- 23y/o) and his family, although she has a few family members that are safe and appropriate, namely the people with whom she currently resides.  MOB reports she is currently residing with distant family members that she has known most of her life.  She reports they are involved and supportive and would like her reside there with the baby for as long as she'd like.  MOB describes a more stable life since she has left the home of her father one year ago.  She reports FOB is very involved and supportive, does not do drugs or smoke, and has no criminal history.  She reports they do not currently reside together, but will eventually once he has stable employment.   MOB reports she has quit smoking 3 months ago and reports no plans to resume.  She reports there are no smokers in the home.    MOB has been observed to be caring for newborn in an appropriate manner and reports this was an unplanned, but desired pregnancy.  MOB reports her desire to parent newborn.    Due to concerns regarding MOB's history of inappropriate parenting role models she was agreeable to a referral to in-home services with Healthy Start and referral has been generated.

Indication: [**NAME**] is a 25 y.o. female para 3003 who was scheduled for repeat cesarean at 37 weeks due to a prior history of uterine window. The patient desired permanent sterilization.  Procedure: After satisfactory anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped in a routine fashion for abdominal surgery.  Time-out confirmed patient and procedure.  The abdomen was entered with a Pfannenstiel approach. The medial aspect of the each rectus muscle was transected with cautery to access the uterus.  A bladder flap was created and then a transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and extended laterally with the surgeon's fingers. The lower uterine segment was very thin but did not have an obvious window.  Amniotic fluid was clear.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation.  The cord was clamped and cut and the baby handed to the pediatrician.  Blood for gases and DNA was obtained.  The placenta was delivered with cord traction.  The uterus was wiped out with a lap.  The uterus was closed in a single layer closure using 0-Monocryl. The right fallopian tube was identified by the fimbria, grasped and elevated with a babcock. The mesosalpinx beneath the isthmic portion of the tube was cauterized with bovey. The tube was double ligated with 1-Plain gut suture and the intervening segment excised. The left fallopian tube was identified by the fimbria, grasped and elevated with a babcock. The mesosalpinx beneath the isthmic portion of the tube was cauterized with bovey. The tube was double ligated with 1-Plain gut suture and the intervening segment excised.   The uterus was reexamined and found to be hemostatic. The fascia was closed with 2 suture/s of 0-Vicryl starting at the angle and running in a continuous fashion. The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and reapproximated with 0-Chromic. The skin was closed with 4-0 Monocryl.  Steri strips and a bandage were applied.  The vagina was cleared of clots.

SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY: Placenta   INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 21 y.o. female para 0 at 28w0d who was admitted as a transfer for severe pre-eclampsia.  She was given magnesium sulfate, IV antihypertensives including labetala and hydralazine were administered for severe range BP, she also received her first dose of betamethasone. Fetal status deteriorated with a low baseline in the 100's and absent variability. The decision to proceed with Stat Cesarean Delivery was made following a prolonged deceleration to the 80's.  DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table. A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed. After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.  The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a STAT Pfannenstiel incision. A bladder flap was not created. A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with the surgeons fingers. The amniotic fluid was clear. The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation. The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood was obtained for analysis. The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap. The uterus was exteriorized, and the uterine incision was closed in 2 layers, the first a running suture of 0 Monocryl and the second a running, imbricating suture of 0 Monocryl.  The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity. Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision, posterior to the bladder, and in the subfascial area. The fascia was closed with one suture of 0 Vicryl beginning from one end of the incision and running across to the other side. The subcutaneous tissue was closed with a running suture of 3-0 Vicryl. The skin was closed with a running subcuticular closure of 4-0 Polysorb. Benzoin, Steri-Strips, and a sterile dressing were applied to the incision. The vagina was cleared of clots.

For this reason the patient was taken to the OR for cesarean delivery.  DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a pfannensteil incision. The incision was taken down to the level of the fascia with sharp dissection; the fascia was scored in the midline. The incision was extended laterally in either direction over the rectus muscles. The fascia was dissected off the rectus muscle superiorly and then inferiorly. The rectus muscle was divided bluntly. The peritoneum was entered in a clear space sharply.  A bladder flap was created.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with blunt dissection  The amniotic fluid was clear.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation. The infant gave a spontaneous cry and extremity movement.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood was obtained for analysis.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.  The uterus was exteriorized, and the uterine incision was closed in 2 layers, the first a running locking suture of 0-vicryl and the second a running, imbricating suture of 0-vicryl.  The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity.  Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision, posterior to the bladder, and in the subfascial area.  The fascia was reapproximated with 0 Vicryl starting at the angle and running in a continuous fashion.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated.  The skin was closed with a running subcuticular closure of 3-0 monocryl.  Steri-Strips and a sterile dressing were applied to the incision.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.

She then told staff today she made up the story as she did not want her boyfriend to know the truth. She told the medical staff today she planned to give the infant to her sister in law at bedside. She did not convey this information to me. I met with Ms. [**NAME**] and her sister in law at bedside. She explained the baby was a result of a drunken one night stand and that she did not know how far along she was as she thought the baby would be delivered in February. She did not indicate any plans to give the infant to her sister in law.   She has been dating her boyfriend named [**NAME**] for the past year. They live in [**LOCATION_CITY**] with her two children ages 1 and 2. She stated they have a 2 bedroom home and that Mr. [**NAME**] works at TB Landmark laying pipe. She is a stay at home mother. She expressed she does not receive Medicaid as the case was closed and does not have WIC. She voiced the other children are followed by [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] Pediatrics in [**LOCATION_CITY**]. When exploring her lack of prenatal care she voiced she didn't get around to it as she was moving. She voiced initially there has never been a history of drug use of child protective services involvement. She later stated that DCF was involved as she tested positive for drugs at her last child's birth, but cannot remember what drugs. Per chart screening she tested positive for crystal meth at her last delivery in [**DATE**] and stated it was a one time use. She was not drug tested this delivery.   Ms. [**NAME**] described adequate preparation for the infant's care. She is breast feeding and planned to change to bottle feedings. She stated plans to use broth control pills. She voiced the father of her other two children was abusive and is not involved or supportive. Mr. [**NAME**] and her other two children are currently at the [**LOCATION_OTHER**] Hunting Camp at [**LOCATION_STREET**] in Cross City with plans to stay there through this week.  I explained the plan to contact the Florida Abuse Hotline based on the concerns of a lack of prenatal care and prior drug use. I am also concerned about the various reports of plans for this infant and Ms. [**NAME**] did not indicate to me a plan to give the infant to her sister in law. Ms. [**NAME**] presents as a poor historian and has frequent changes in her explanations to staff. The report was accepted at the Florida Abuses Hotline by Alphonso ID# [**ID**]. Please do not discharge this infant prior to contacting social work services for the discharge plan.",3

The baby stayed on the right breast 15 minutes. Mom did a lot of skin to skin and reports she wants to go to sleep now. I swaddled the baby and gave the baby to grandma. Mom instructed to breast feed on demand and allow the baby to stay on the breast until he is not doing any nutritive sucking. Grandma requested a pacifier and I made her aware of the risk of using a pacifier and she insisted that the FOB wants the baby to have a pacifier. In the meantime the FOB was sleeping and the MOB kept quiet. Upon my assessment of the baby's mouth the baby does have tight frenulum;however, the baby was able to maintain a good latch.

Ovaries and tubes were not visualized. Liveborn infant male weighing 3764 grams with Apgars of 9 and 9.  SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY: Placenta   INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 31 y.o. female para 1001 at 38 weeks. She was undergoing induction secondary to a history of polyhydramnios that had required amnioreduction. She progressed to 9 cm and did not dilate further. The fetal heart tracing showed repetitive deep variable decelerations to the 60s. She did not have adequate contractions but the pitocin could not be titrated secondary to the fetal heart tracing.   DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfannenstiel incision. The incision was taken down to the level of the fascia which was incised in the midline. The incision was extended laterally in either direction over the rectus muscles. The fascia was dissected off the rectus muscle superiorly and then inferiorly. The rectus muscle was divided bluntly. The peritoneum was entered in a clear space sharply.  A bladder flap was created.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with the surgeon's fingers.  The amniotic fluid was clear.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood was obtained for analysis. Cord blood collection was performed.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.  The uterus was not exteriorized.  The uterine incision was closed in two layers, the first a locking suture of 0-vicryl and the second a running, imbricating suture of 0-vicryl. Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision, posterior to the bladder, and in the subfascial area.  The fascia was closed with two sutures of 0 Vicryl beginning from either end of the incision and meeting in the midportion.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and re-approximated with a running suture of 0-chromic.  The skin was closed with a running subcuticular closure of 4-0 Monocryl.  Dermabond was applied to the incision.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.  [**NAME**], MD   Dictated for Dr. [**NAME**]   I was present and scrubbed for the entire procedure.

Secondary to nonreassuring fetal heart tracing, IOL was started with pitocin once patient was status post betamethasone injections. Patient again started having repetitive variable decelerations despite amnioinfusion and vaginal bleeding, concerning for abruption. The decision was made to proceed with induction and trial of vaginal delivery as the fetal heart rate tracing was overall reassuring. Shortly after patient had her first episode of bleeding (see notes for more details), she was found to be completely dilated and went on to deliver a liveborn infant male, weighing 2078 g with Apgars of 9 and 9. Following delivery, patient had a postpartum hemorrhage requiring manual extraction of clots from LUS, a total of 40 units of pitocin, and misoprostol 1000 mg per rectum.

Procedure: After satisfactory anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped in a routine fashion for abdominal surgery.  Time-out confirmed patient and procedure.  The abdomen was entered with a pfannensteil approach.  A bladder flap was created and then a transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and extended laterally with the surgeon's fingers.  Amniotic fluid was clear.  The above described infant A was delivered from the Breech presentation.  The cord was clamped after 30 seconds and cut and the baby handed to the pediatrician.  Blood for gases and DNA was obtained.  The above described infant B was delivered from the Cephalic presentation.  The cord was clamped after 30 seconds and cut and the baby handed to the pediatrician.  Blood for gases and DNA was obtained. The placenta was delivered with cord traction.  The uterus was wiped out with a lap.  The uterus was closed in a single layer closure using 0-vicrly.   The right fallopian tube was identified by the fimbria, double ligated with 0-chromic suture and the intervening segment excised.  The left fallopian tube was identified by the fimbria, double ligated with 0-chromic suture and the intervening segment excised.    The fascia was closed with 1 suture of 0-Vicryl starting at the angle and running in a continuous fashion. The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated.  The skin was closed with 4-0 polysorb.

Liveborn infant female weighing 3697 grams with Apgars of 7 and 9.  SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY:  Segments from each tube  INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 31 y.o. female para 1001 who presented for scheduled repeat cesarean section. She had a prior LTCS x 1 and declined a trial of labor after cesarean section.   DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfanenstiel incision.  A bladder flap was not created.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with traction.  The amniotic fluid was clear.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood was obtained for analysis.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap x 2.  The uterus was exteriorized, and the uterine incision was closed in two layers, the first a running suture of 0 Vicryl and the second a running, imbricating suture of 0 Monocryl.    The right fallopian tube was identified to its fimbriated end and a defect was made in a relatively avascular portion of the mesosalpinx underlying the mid isthmic portion of the tube.  A segment of the mid isthmic portion of the tube was ligated with two sutures of 1 Plain Gut suture and the intervening portion of the tube excised and handed off the field; adequate hemostasis was assured.  The exact same procedure was performed on the opposite side after identifying that tube to its fimbriated end; again, adequate hemostasis was assured.  The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity.  Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision and in the subfascial area.  The fascia was re-approximated with one suture of 0 Vicryl beginning from one corner of the incision and running to the opposite corner.  The subcutaneous tissue was not reapproximated due to subcutaneous tissue with depth less than 1 cm.  The skin was closed with a running subcuticular closure of 3-0 Monocryl.  Benzoin, Steri-Strips, and a sterile dressing were applied to the incision.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.

However, while speaking with MOB, she stated that she named baby ""[**NAME**]"" after her mother who passed away last year.  MOB then began to cry.  SW provided support and talked with MOB about how the joy of having a baby can sometimes bring pain especially because it was her mother who passed away. SW educated MOB about post-partum depression and talked with her about her increased risk because of the recent death of her mother. MOB declined referral for Healthy Start at this time, but SW informed her that she could request a referral from baby's pediatrician if she finds she needs to access their free counseling program.    MOB also reported experiencing stress because she is caring for baby in hospital room alone as FOB is at home with the couples' daughter (age 3).  MOB stated she is trying to breast feed for the first time and it is not going well.  SW encouraged MOB to request help from nurse and lactation consultant as MOB stated baby is hurting her breasts.  SW also encouraged her to do what is best for her and her baby.

Liveborn infant female weighing 3456 grams with Apgars of 8 and 9.  Indication: [**NAME**] is a 26 y.o. female para 0 who was admitted with spontaneous rupture of membranes at 3/C/-1. She was started on pitocin and progressed to 5/C/0 but did not progress further despite adequate uterine contractions on pitocin. She developed chorioamnionitis and was started on antibiotics. After 5 hours of no cervical change she was agreeable to delivery via cesarean section.   Procedure: After satisfactory anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped in a routine fashion for abdominal surgery.  Time-out confirmed patient and procedure.  The abdomen was entered with a Pfannensteil approach.  A bladder flap was created and then a transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and extended laterally with the surgeon's fingers.  Amniotic fluid was cloudy white.  The above described infant was delivered from the cephalic presentation.  The cord was clamped and cut and the baby handed to the pediatrician.  Blood for gases and DNA was obtained.  The placenta was delivered with cord traction.  The uterus was wiped out with a lap.  The uterus was closed in a double layer closure using 0-monocryl. The first layer was sewn in a running locked fashion from angle to angle. The second layer was an imbricating layer sewn across the hysterotomy. The fascia was closed with 1 suture of 0-Vicryl starting at the angle and running in a continuous fashion. The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and reapproximated with a single running stitch of 3-0 vicryl.  The skin was closed with 4-0 monocryl in an intracuticular fashion.  Steristrips (without benzoin) were applied and an OpSite dressing was applied.  The vagina was cleared of clots.

Lactation Note: mom states that the baby is hungry all the time. She does not she feels like she has enough milk. And she is supplementing with 20 ml of Enfamil at every feed. She has been letting the baby wait every 3 hours because the baby needs to be under lights. Mom was reminded of the importance of breastfeeding on demand. When I walked the baby was acting famished he was seeking a nipple that was right in front of him. I hand expressed her milk and the baby latched but sucked a little and started crying and was agitated. I used a supplemental feeder at the breast with the 20 mls mom gives and the baby stayed on the left breast 15 minutes and took 8 mls of the supplement and he stayed on the right breast about 25 minutes + and finished the supplement via supplemental feeder. Mom instructed to continue to pump after breastfeeding for 10 minutes and hand express and she should supplement with her expressed milk. Mom appears tired and not focused. I told her that it was normal to feel sleepy during breastfeeding due to the oxytocin and she should try to sleep after she pumps. I was able to palpate a knot on the right lateral side of her right breast. Mom instructed to put a warm compress and pump after breastfeeding.

Liveborn infant male weighing 3052 grams with Apgars of 7 and 9.  SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY: placenta  INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 22 y.o. female para 0 at 41w2d who progressed to complete and developed chorioamnionitis.  She pushed for 3 hours with no change in descent and the decision was made to proceed with cesarean delivery  DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfanenstiel incision.  A bladder flap was created.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with bandage scissors.  The amniotic fluid was thick meconium stained.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood was obtained for analysis.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.  The uterus was exteriorized, and it was noted that there was a 3 cm extension on the left lateral edge of the hysterotomy.  It was closed separately with a running suture of 0-Monocryl.  Then, the uterine incision was closed in two layers, the first a running suture of 0 Monocryl and the second a running, imbricating suture of 0 Monocryl.    Atony was noted and additional 40 units of pitocin was administered.  Methergine was given x 1 and hemabate was given x 2, 15 minutes apart, one IM and one intrauterine.  Tone improved after the uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity.    Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision and in the subfascial area.  Additional figure of eight sutures were placed on the rectus muscle for hemostasis.  The fascia was closed with one suture of 0 Vicryl beginning from one end of the incision and running across.  The subcutaneous tissue was closed with a running suture of 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with a running subcuticular closure of 4-0 Polysorb.

"Date of Surgery: [**DATE**]  Preoperative Diagnosis:  1) IUP at 40 weeks  2) Polyhydramnios 3) Arrest of dilation  4) Failed induction of labor   Postoperative Diagnosis: Same   Operation Performed: Primary Low Transverse Cesarean Section  Surgeon: [**NAME**]  Assistant: [**NAME**]   Anesthesiologist: [**NAME**]  Anesthesiology Assistant: [**NAME**]   Anesthesia: Spinal   Pathology: Placenta   EBL: 1000 ml  Findings: Normal uterus, tubes and ovaries bilaterally.  Liveborn infant male weighing 4183 grams with Apgars of 9 and 9.  Indication: [**NAME**] is a 28 y.o. female para 0 who presented at 40 weeks for scheduled induction of labor for idiopathic polyhydramnios. She progressed to 5 cm but had no descent with fetal station at -3 and ballotable. She made no progress on pitocin for greater than 12 hours and was offered primary cesarean for failure to progress.   Procedure: After satisfactory anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped in a routine fashion for abdominal surgery.  Time-out confirmed patient and procedure.  The abdomen was entered with a Pfannensteil approach. The fascia was scored with a scalpel and cut laterally with curved mayo scissors. The fascia was dissected off the underlying muscle. The rectus muscles were separated and the peritoneum incised with Metzenbaum scissors. The peritoneum was stretched and a bladder blade placed in the lower aspect of the abdominal cavity to expose the lower uterine segment. The uterus was palpated and was found to be extremely dextrorotated.  A bladder flap was created and then a transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and extended laterally with the surgeon's fingers.  Amniotic fluid was copious and clear.  The above described infant was delivered from the vertex presentation with the aid of a Kiwi vacuum.  The cord was clamped and cut and the baby handed to the pediatrician.  Blood for gases and DNA was obtained.  The placenta was delivered with cord traction and sent to pathology.  The uterus was wiped out with a lap.  Uterine atony was diagnosed and 40 units of pitocin was started on a pressure bag with fundal massage. A B-Lynch stitch was placed in the usual fashion using #1 chromic gut suture and tied down. The uterus was closed in a double layer closure. The first stitch was a running, unlocked stitch of 0-vicryl. The second an imbricating layer of 0-vicryl.  The fascia was closed with 2 sutures of 0-Vicryl starting at the angle and running in a continuous fashion to meet at midline. The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and reapproximated with a running stitch of 3-0 vicryl.  The skin was closed with a running intracuticular stitch of 3-0 monocryl.  Steristrips and a sterile dressing were applied.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.

Normal tubes and ovaries bilaterally with exception of small bilateral paratubal cysts.  Liveborn infant female weighing 2151grams with Apgars of 8 and 9.  SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY: placenta  INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 24 y.o. female para 1001 who presented with PPROM at 34w5d. Was started on pitocin to augment labor and progressed to 6 cm but began to have repetitive decelerations and noted to have approx 150-200cc blood out with clots suspicious for abruption. Decision was made to proceed to OR for cesarean delivery. Developed more persistent bradycardia en route to OR and proceeded to stat cesarean.   DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfannenstiel incision. The incision was taken down to the level of the fascia which was incised in the midline. The incision was extended laterally in either direction over the rectus muscles. The fascia was dissected off the rectus muscle superiorly and then inferiorly. The rectus muscle was divided bluntly. The peritoneum was entered in a clear space bluntly.  A bladder flap was not created.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with the surgeon's fingers.  The amniotic fluid was clear.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood was obtained for analysis.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.  The uterus was exteriorized, and the uterine incision was closed in 2 layers, the first a running, locking suture of 0-vicryl and the second a running, imbricating suture of 0-vicryl.  The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity.  Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision, posterior to the bladder, and in the subfascial area.  The fascia was closed with one suture of 0 Vicryl beginning from either one of the incision and running continuously.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and did not require re-approximation.  The skin was closed with a running subcuticular closure of 3-0 monocryl.  Benzoin, Steri-Strips, and a sterile dressing were applied to the incision.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.  [**NAME**], MD  Dictated for Dr. [**NAME**]",0

P0 at 35w0d with a history of T2DM on glyburide and gestational hypertension and DM who had been monitored on L&D for variable decels in her clinic NST a couple days prior.  Tracing had been moderate variability with occasional variable decels until evening of [**DATE**] when variability decreased.  A biophysical profile was performed and was [**DATE**] (2 points off for breathing and 2 points off for movement). Delivery was indicated and while discussing possible route of delivery with the patient, she had a prolonged deceleration and was transported to the OR.  In the OR FHTs were in the 130s with moderate variability.  At that time cesarean delivery was recommended because of suspected fetal intolerance of labor very remote from delivery.  Because of the normal FHR at that time, it was determined that there was time to establish regional anesthesia and reduce maternal aspiration risks, and anesthesia placed a spinal in less than 5 minutes and we proceeded rapidly with cesarean delivery.  DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfannenstiel incision. The incision was taken down to the level of the fascia which was incised in the midline. The incision was extended laterally in either direction over the rectus muscles. The fascia was dissected off the rectus muscle superiorly and then inferiorly. The rectus muscle was divided bluntly. The peritoneum was entered in a clear space sharply.  A bladder flap was not created.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with the surgeon's fingers and bandage scissors.  The amniotic fluid was clear.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation.  Delayed cord clamping was considered, however there was little blood in the umbilical cord and the baby was limp so the cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting NICU 111 team. A sample of cord and cord blood was obtained for analysis.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.  The uterus was exteriorized, and the uterine incision was closed in 2 layers, the first a running suture of 0-Vicryl and the second a running, imbricating suture of 0-Vicryl.   The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity.  Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision, posterior to the bladder, and in the subfascial area.  The fascia was closed with one suture of 0 Vicryl beginning at one end of the incision and running to the other.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and re-approximated with a running suture of 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with a running subcuticular closure of 3-0 Monocryl. Dermabond was applied to the incision. The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.

"I went and talked to patient about her concerns: restarting the pitocin and fetal intolerance to labor, her being tired of being induced.  I explained that Dr. [**NAME**] and I would recommend continuing to try to proceed with induction at this time as the FHT is reassuring and that we try to prevent the first cesarean delivery when at all possible.  I acknowledged her concern about fetal well being and I explained that if there is evidence of intolerance to labor with no cervical change, we would go ahead and proceed with cesarean delivery but performing a cesarean at this time does not seem indicated.  Cesarean is not without maternal risks and with future pregnancies she may need repeat cesarean deliveries which would also not be without increasing maternal risks (infection, bleeding, injury to internal organs, etc).  She expressed understanding and is willing to proceed with one more trial of restarting pitocin.  [**NAME**], RN present for discussion.  [**NAME**] MD",0

MOB stated she wishes she was told to go through the week of hell for detox, instead of getting on methadone for 6 years (!). MOB stated that she has always been compliant at [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] and had no problem with signing the Authorization to Request Protected Health Information from Other Providers so that SW can follow-up with Meridian. SW will have to follow-up on Tuesday.   SW was previously made aware by nurse that MOB stopped nurse from giving her methadone, stating ""I have my own methadone with me."" Some confusion may have occurred concerning this situation. MOB stated that when she arrived on L&D, before she delivered her baby, MOB informed her nurse that she had her own prescription of methadone and would not need the medical staff to give her any doses. MOB stated no one made a big deal out of this and she took her medication as prescribed. When MOB arrived on the Mother-Baby Unit, MOB stated that she expected that she would continue taking her own medication. SW explained to MOB that her MBU nurse was following hospital protocol. SW explained that patients are not allowed to take their own medications (even ibuprofen or Tylenol) because of the danger of getting double doses. MOB stated she now understands. SW thanked MOB for her honesty about having her own medication with her.   To be clear, MOB did not take a double dose of methadone. She was honest about taking her own medication and refused the medication so she would not be double dosed.  During this assessment, SW observed MOB and her daughters caring for and bonding with baby. SW also observed MOB appropriately disciplining her daughters (who are very well behaved and clean).   SW educated MOB about SIDS, Back to Sleep, Shaken Baby Syndrome, protecting baby from 2nd and 3rd-hand smoke, and Post-Partum Depression.  SW needs to contact Meridian to verify MOB's participation and compliance with the Methadone Clinic. Please contact SW before baby's discharge.",0

Her exam at that time was 5/C/BB. The suture had not pulled through. She was given a 1000cc bolus of LR and her magnesium was increased gradually to 4, but her contractions persisted and increased in intensity. Repeat exam showed increased bloody mucous on perineum and the cervix was 6/C/BB. The suture had not pulled through, but she stated that she could not bear the pain any longer. The decision was made to place an epidural and remove the patient's cerclage. The patient was transported to the operating room where an epidural was placed. The NICU team was assembled in the operating room. She was then examined and the cervix was noted to be C/C/BB to introitus. The suture could not be palpated. The patient began spontaneously pushing and the baby was delivered en caul. The baby was removed from the amniotic sac, the umbilical cord doubly clamped and cut, and the baby was handed off to the neonatology team waiting in the room to begin resuscitation.  Pitocin IV infusion was started. The patient's vagina and cervix were examined. The cerclage remained in place. The cerclage knot at 12 o'clock was grasped with a Kelly, elevated, cut, and removed intact. The patient's cervix was examined again and no lacerations were noted. There were no vaginal lacerations.

P1001 who had a vaginal delivery complicated by a mild shoulder dystocia. She was found to have at least a third degree laceration immediately postpartum, but was taken to the operating room for further diagnosis and repair with the aid of optimal anesthesia, lighting, and positioning   DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in low lithotomy position and her abdomen and legs were prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  An exam under anesthesia was performed, confirming the fourth degree perineal laceration. The rectal mucosa was re-approximated with a running suture of 4-0 Vicryl. The rectal submucosal tissue was re-approximated with a running suture of 3-0 Vicryl. The muscle of the external anal sphincter and the overlying supporting capsule were re-approximated with interrupted sutures of 2-0 Vicryl placed through the capsule.  Attention was then turned to the right sulcal laceration, which was repaired with a running, locked suture of 3-0 Vicryl. Finally, the 2nd degree perineal laceration was repaired in the usual fashion with a running suture of 3-0 Vicryl.  A rectal examination was performed, and no suture or defects were palpable.  A Foley catheter was placed in her bladder.  All counts were correct at the end of procedure. The patient was taken down from low lithotomy position and transferred to the recovery room in good condition.  [**NAME**], MD  Dictated for Dr. [**NAME**]   I was present for the entire case.

"Lactation Note: Mom had the baby swaddled in her arms when I entered her room. The baby was awake and showing feeding cues. I offered mom to help her with latching the baby onto the breast, she said that the baby was not hungry because he lets her know when he is hungry when he grabs her breast. I taught her the feeding cues and asked if I could assess(touch) her breast and with her permission I taught her how to do hand expression but she kept making sounds of pain before I could massage her breast. I got a couple of drop from her right breast and nothing from the left nipple. I tried to latch the baby onto the breast and the baby would not latch. Mom became upset and said that her baby was not hungry. I reminded her that it was 10:30 am and the baby last breast fed at 6:00 am. I used the 20 mm nipple shield she had in the room and I cleaned with soap and hot water and she got upset that I cleaned it because she did not want the baby to get soap and she said the nipple shield was sterile. Mom instructed that it is important to clean the nipple shield after every use. I changed the nipple shield size to a 16 mm.I tried to hand express her colostrum to the tip of the nipple shield and she kept c/o that this was not done yesterday and the baby breast fed well. I asked mom to show me how she positions and latches the baby onto the breast. Mom place the baby in a cradle hold with the hands in front of him, his body facing the ceiling as he sucked on the tip of the nipple shied. Mom instructed to face the baby  towards her and she just kept the baby in the incorrect position. I encouraged mom to try the football hold. I helped her and the baby would not stayed latched onto the breast and she thought the baby was not hungry. I helped re- latch the baby onto the breast in a football hold, and I made her aware that the baby was having difficulty with breastfeeding . Mom states that she is worried that he is not eating and that may she should use formula or pump and bottle feed. When the baby was placed facing her; she c/o the baby's clamp hurting her and when I asked her to hold her baby to breast feed she threw her head back on the pillow in frustration, and she said she was tired and the baby was not hungry. I made her aware that I was going to let the doctor know about the breastfeeding issues.I spoke to her  Nurse Ashly and case manager(social worker) I told them that I am concerned about the baby's safety, from what I was able to assess mom does not have the capacity, or the level of intelligence to understand the consequences of not feeding the baby or sleeping with the baby in her arms as already observed. She needs to be supervised as she takes care of her baby. The baby's face had a yellow appearance and slight petechiae noted on his forehead. Md [**NAME**] aware and he agreed that maybe it would be safer for mom to bottle feed. The patient's nurse made me aware that mom is not able to express any milk via pumping.

SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY: Placenta   INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 27 y.o. female para 2032 with a history of di/di twin pregnancy who was admitted in preterm labor. She received a steroid course and was transferred to the floor. Tonight, she began having contractions for about 20 minutes and was brought to Labor and Delivery and found to be completely dilated. She desired delivery via cesarean. Given rapid progression decision was made with anesthesia team to proceed with general anesthesia.  DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  The patient was placed in the dorsal supine position and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning. General anesthesia was then administered.  The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfannensteil incision. The incision was taken down to the level of the fascia which was incised in the midline. The incision was extended laterally in either direction over the rectus muscles.  The rectus muscle was divided bluntly. The peritoneum was entered in a clear space bluntly.  A bladder flap was not created.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with the surgeon's fingers. Immediately 500cc blood clot was found in the uterus consistant with an acute placental abruption. The amniotic fluid was bloody . The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. The second amniotic sac was ruptured with clear fluid. The second twin was delivered from the breech presentation. The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood was obtained for analysis from both cords.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.  The uterus was exteriorized, and the uterine incision was closed in two layers, the first a locking suture of 0-Vicryl and the second a running, imbricating suture of 0-vicryl. Hemostasis was achieved with a figure of eight suture of 3-0 vicryl.  The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity.  Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision, posterior to the bladder, and in the subfascial area. The muscle was found to be bleeding and hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery. Arista was applied to the area for further hemostasis.  The fascia was closed with a running suture of 0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and hemostasis noted. The skin was closed with staples.  A sterile dressing was applied to the incision.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.

The baby had about 25 mls.. Mom was instructed to pump every time she feeds the baby a bottle; I told her the risk of decreased milk supply.

MOB reported that she started her prenatal care at around 30 wks gestation at Putnum OBGYN. MOB stated that she did not know she was pregnant until late in her pregnancy because she was not gaining weight and continued to get her period. SW informed MOB that her records showed only two visits at Putnum OBGYN and MOB confirmed this information. MOB stated that she was supposed to come to Women's Healthy at [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] (because of High Risk Pregnancy), but did not because it was too far. SW talked with MOB about the importance of early, consistent prenatal care. It should be noted that MOB's prenatal records from Putnum OBGYN included a UDS positive for methamphetamines on [**DATE**]) and the OBGYN informed MOB that she needed to get prenatal care at [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] because of her drug use.

MOB only said ""Really?!?"" However, she did not deny using the drugs. SW asked MOB if she had history with any other drug use. MOB stated that she was using IV dilaudid about a year ago, but has not used any in about a year.  SW informed MOB that because of her drug use during pregnancy and her (and baby's) positive drug screen at delivery, SW would be contacting DCF. MOB responded appropriately, and did not appear surprised. SW educated MOB about SIDS, Back to Sleep, Shaken Baby Syndrome, and Post-Partum Depression.  After leaving MOB's room, SW called DCF Child Abuse Hotline ([**CONTACT_PHONE**]-ABUSE) to make a report concerning the positive UDS for methamphetamines, opiates, and marijuana and because of drug use throughout pregnancy.

Bicornuate uterus with rudimentary right horn and pregnancy located in primary left horn, normal left tube and ovary.  Right tube and ovary obscured by adhesions.  Liveborn infant male weighing 3864 grams with Apgars of 8 and 9.  Bladder intact without spill of sterile milk after backfill at end of case.  Indication: [**NAME**] is a 37 y.o. female para 3104 at 37 weeks gestation who presented for scheduled repeat cesearean delivery and BTI.  Her pregnancy had been complicated by a history of 3 prior cesarean deliveries with high suspicion of severe adhesive disease, hypothyroidism, gestational diabetes, and a bicornuate uterus.  She was admitted to L&D and set up for surgery.  Procedure: After satisfactory anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped in a routine fashion for abdominal surgery.  Time-out confirmed patient and procedure.  The abdomen was entered via a low midline vertical incision and dissected down to the level of the fascia with sharp dissection and cautery. The fascia was scored in the midline, grasped on either side with Allis clamps, and extended both superiorly and inferiorly with sharp dissection. The rectus muscles were separated just to the left of the midline until a small area of peritoneum was identified.  The peritoneum was entered with sharp dissection and lifted off of the underlying peritoneum.  Through the peritoneal defect, dense adhesions could be felt between the anterior uterine wall and the overlying omentum, anterior fascial sheath, and bladder.  The peritoneum was tented up off of the uterlying uterus with a hemostat and taken down layer-by-layer both superiorly and inferiorly with Metzenbaum scissors.  When more dense areas of omental adhesion were encountered, they were undermined, doubly clamped with Kellys, the intervening segment incised, and the remaining ends ligated with a combination of Haney stitches and free ties of 2-0 vicryl.  Great care was taken to ensure hemostasis of the remaining omentum both before and after the clamps were removed.  Adhesiolysis continued over the next ~60 minutes as attempts were made to clear an area of the anterior uterus large enough to perform the hysterotomy.  As adhesions were dissected near the lower uterine segment, the bladder was back-filled with 200cc of sterile saline so that the borders of the bladder could be identified and avoided.  The bladder was adhered low on the uterine segment, therefore this area was avoided at the time of hysterotomy.  Instead, a transverse incision was made slightly above the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and extended laterally with blunt dissection.  No uterine window was identified at the time of hysterotomy.  Amniotic fluid was clear at the time of rupture.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation and gave a spontaneous cry.  The cord was clamped and cut and the baby handed to the pediatrician.  A cord segment and blood for gases and DNA was obtained.   The placenta was delivered with cord traction.  During placental delivery, the uterus was inadvertently inverted then immediately replaced in the appropriate orientation.  The uterus was grasped with a moist lap, exteriorized, and wiped out with a lap.  Ringed forceps were placed on each corner of the hysterotomy.  The uterus was then closed in a double layer closure using two sutures of 0-vicryl. The initial layer was a running locked layer and the second layer was an imbricating layer.  Excellent hemostasis was achieved with a combination of cautery and figure-of-eight sutures as needed.  The uterine tone was noted to be slightly boggy, therefore 40 extra units of pitocin were added to the IVF by anesthesia, methergine was given IM, and 1000mg of cytotec were placed in the rectum after hysterotomy closure.  Uterine tone was noted to be significantly improved.  Attention was then turned to the tubal interruption. The left tube and ovary were easily identified and found to be normal.  A portion of the left tube was grasped with Babcocks and identified by its fimbriated end.  The mid-isthmic portion was pulled up into a loop and ligated with a tie of 0-plain gut suture. A small defect was made in the mesosalpinx underneath the loop and two segments of 0-chromic passed through on a hemostat.  Both sides of the loop were ligated and the intervening segment incised.  The lumen on either side was made hemostatic with cautery.  The right tube was much more difficult to identify as it originated from the rudimetary right horn of the bicornuate uterus.  The round ligament was identified and moved out of the way.  The other nearby tubular structure was grasped with a Babcock, and noted not to contain any vacular or urologic elements.  However, it was impossible to identify this structure as fallopian tube due to absence of visible fimbriae.  The decision was made to place a Filshie clip across a clear portion of this structure near the cornua of the rudimentary right horn. A single clip was loaded in the applicated and placed at a right angle across the tube.  The clip was then closed and the applicator removed.   The uterus was placed back into the peritoneal cavity. Copious irrigation was performed at the abdominal sidewalls and over the hysterotomy site.  The uterine incision was hemostatic and uterine tone adequate. The fascia, muscle, peritoneum, and areas of omental dissection were inspected extensively and were found to be intact and hemostatic.  The bladder was back-filled with 100cc of sterile milk and the pelvis was inspected for any leakage from bladder injury.  None was noted.  Urine in the foley was clear per anesthesia.  The fascia was closed with 2 sutures of 0-PDS starting at the angles and running in a continuous fashion to meet at the midline. The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and then closed with a running stitch of 0-chromic.  The skin was closed with 4-0 monocryl.  Dermabond and a pressure dressing were applied.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.  No complications were encountered during the case.

Lactation Note: the baby was crying and fussing while mom was trying to breast feed. Mom instructed to hold the baby in upright on chest and the baby immediately calm down. I taught mom how to hand express and I gave the baby about 3-4 ml of EBM via spoon. The baby has a receding chin ; I recommended that mom use the football hold to latch the baby onto the breast and bring the chin into the breast. The baby had a good latch with a nutritive suck. The baby was jaundice around the face and was acting sleepy in the beginning of the feed but mom states the baby had just had a circumcision done.  Breast Assessment: Mom' nipples had abrasions vertical and horizontal in appearance. Mom has lanolin and she was instructed to use it. Mom advised to make sure the baby has a deep latch; Having both the nipple and part of the Areola in his mother. Close =Comfort.   Discharge: Mom has a f/u appt with the pediatrician tomorrow.

"This note was copied from the chart of GIRL/Savanna Dye. Lactation:  Discharge rounding with 22-year-old mother and her newborn daughter born at 40 weeks 2 days gestation by SVD, weighing 2.235g.  Mother was adequately treated for CZ infection during pregnancy.  Baby had in utero tobacco exposure. Baby is not in mother's room due to a car seat challenge related to the baby's small size.  Mother reports baby is nursing well, and denies any nipple soreness during the feeds.   Mother does plan to work outside the home at some point, although she did not work outside the home with her first child who is now 15 months old.  Parents and their 15-month-old have been residing with the maternal grandparents here in [**LOCATION_CITY**].   Lactation history:  The older sibling was breastfed x 3 months.  Mother cites the difficulty at three months as a time when friends would frequently come by to visit without knocking, and she was uncomfortable nursing around others.  Mother also reports that she stopped breastfeeding suddenly at 3 months, and her breasts soon became ""sunken in"" for a time.  Maternal breast assessment:  Medium to large breasts are closely spaced and rounded, and the nipples are nonreddened and intact.   Discussion with recommendations:  We discussed the mother's first lactation experience and her sudden termination of breastfeeding, followed by a ""sunken-in"" appearance of her breasts for a period of time.  Mother was advised that this is referred to as breast involution, and frequently occurs when there is a sudden weaning versus a gradual weaning, though the mother's breasts typically return to their former tone within two to 3 menstrual cycles.   We discussed the expected onset of the mother's second milk, Lactogenesis II [L2], with the recommendation for frequent feeds to quickly address any breast engorgement.  Mother describes her previous lactation experience with breast engorgement as particularly dramatic, but improving within one to 2 days.  Mother was advised that this is the typical experience of most mothers, although a small number of mothers do experience a longer period of breast engorgement prior to its resolution.  Mother was reassured that the swelling with breast engorgement is many extra red blood cells and additional lymph fluid that supports the second milk coming in, but these extra fluids in the breasts are only needed to establish the second milk.  Continuation of the milk supply is based upon frequency of emptying the breasts, which stimulates frequent refill.    Mother is enrolled with WIC, and breastfeeding support was discussed through the WIC program.  Mother was provided with a pump kit as well as demonstration of the Medela Harmony manual pump, the type of pump the mother had used with her first child.  Mother was invited to our new mothers' breastfeeding support group, along with her children.",3

She has had myoclonic jerks however, most recent one in the past 24 hours.  Pt's keppra level can go down during pregnancy. For this reason we would recommend increasing keppra to 2000mg BID. We would recommend checking keppra levels and zonegran levels monthly through out pregnancy as this can vary with pregnancy. These will take a few days to result. We would also recommend that the pt be continued on 4mg of folic acid thorough out her pregnancy.  Would also avoid benzo for treatment myoclonic jerks. Can use benzo for treatment of generalized tonic clonic seizures.   These recommendations were relayed to the ob/gyn team.   Will leave updated recs after AED levels are back.",0

"Lactation note: I met this pt this morning to offer her assistance with breast pumping. She verbalized a strong desire to give her baby breast milk while he is in the NICU because she ""knows he needs it"". She also states she does not intend to continue breast feeding when he is a little older. She states she has only pumped randomly about six times since his birth. I assured her that my job is to support her decision and assist her in developing her milk supply. I instructed her on breast massage and hand expression and provided her a handout for education reinforcement. After performing breast massage she had a drop of visible colostrum in her right breast. I educated her on proper cleaning of her pump supplies and encouraged her to take all her supplies with her at D/C to continue using in the NICU pumping room. The breast pump was attached to her breasts and placed on the premie setting. The pt is using a 27 mm flange on both breasts and denies any discomfort with their use. Her nipples are slightly flat but evert with the breast pump suction. I instructed her to use the premie setting for the full 15 minutes and to pump consistently every 2-2.5 hours during the day and at least once during the night and early morning when her prolactin level is high. The pt has some eyesight compromise and verbalizes that it is difficult for her to see. After placing her bed down on the lowest level I encouraged her to call for assistance whenever she needs it. She plans to visit the NICU after she finishes pumping. I noted the numer for the WIC office on her pumping packet and instructed her to call them to notify them of her baby's birth and her plan to breast feed.

"Chief Note  To bedside with Dr. [**NAME**] and Dr. [**NAME**].  Briefly, she is a 26 y.o. P0 at 38w2d now almost 48 hours into induction of labor for gestational hypertension.  Her foley bulb came out in the early morning of [**DATE**].  Her cervix has remained at essentially [**DATE**] since, although her cervix was initially difficult to examine.  We discussed with the patient that her pitocin has been at 26 all day and that her cervix has not made any change.  In order to proceed with induction, we will need to rupture her membranes and allow her fetus to apply pressure to her cervix.  We discussed the risk of cord prolapse and non-reassuring feta tracing, including fetal death secondary to these risks, and the need for emergent cesarean delivery should this occur.  Consents: Cesarean delivery Specific counseling: The patient was counseled on risks, benefits, indications and alternatives to cesarean delivery, including bleeding, infection, damage to adjacent organs or the fetus, and reaction to anesthesia. Patient understands the risks, accepts the risks including but not limited to those above, and consents to the procedure.  Consents signed and on chart.  Blood Transfusion Specific Counseling: The patient was counseled on risks, benefits, indications and alternatives to blood transfusion, including infection (HIV, hepatitis, CMV, unknown), transfusion reaction, allergic reaction, metabolic complications, cardiac arrhythmia, and death. Patient understands the risks, accepts the risks including but not limited to those above, and consents to blood transfusion should it become necessary.  Consents signed and on chart.  The patient was then placed in dorsal lithotomy position and Dr. [**NAME**] attempted to examine her cervix.  Fundal pressure was applied and her legs were held in McRoberts position, however she was unable to obtain clear access to the membranes for safe rupture.   At this time I took over.  SVE [**DATE**].  Amniotomy performed with slow release of clear fluid.  Multiple rechecks were made to assure there was no cord prolapse.  At the end of the controlled release, the fetal head was much more well-applied to the cervix.  A: Successful amniotomy at 2100.   P: Continue pitocin IOL, increase per protocol.

"Lactation assistance: The pt welcomed me warmly upon my introduction and offering for assistance. She verbalized immediately some concerns with baby's latch and nipple trauma to her right breast. She stated that baby had nursed for 45 minutes earlier and she felt the pain but did not know what to do so she kept nursing. She denies any pain on the left breast but said she was unable to latch baby on that side anyway. She has pendulous supple breasts with slightly everted nipples that respond to well to tactile stimulation. I first instructed her on STS with its many benefits and breast massage and hand expression during which I undressed baby and placed her STS. Colostrum was readily expressed and baby was placed in a football hold and was easily asymmetrically latched to the breast. I explained the details of a deep latch with the chin tucked into the breast, good support to the neck and shoulders and a clear airway to the nose. The patient practiced breast massage, hand expression and a supportive hand hold in a safe manner for her and baby. I provided her with written materials for her education reinforcement. The baby was noted to chomp and some nipple compression was noted on the left nipple when baby was detached. I informed the Peds service and requested an assessment with the baby exam. Nipple cream was provided for the pt's comfort and instructions on its use.",1
Pt called out stating she thought her water broke. Dr. [**NAME**] at bs for exam.  Pt did not SROM but she is now 4 cm.,0
Lactation assistance: The pt verbalized great satisfaction at my arrival and verbalized concerns about the baby's latch. I educated her on how to support the baby's shoulders while latching baby close to her breast so chin touches and head tilts back to facilitate an assymetric latch. Baby nursed on mothers left breast for several minutes without the use of a nipple shield. Breast massage and hand expression were taught and the pt demonstrated both techniques appropriately. The breastfeeding booklet and invitation to the breast feeding support group were provided. The pt called me back about an hour later as she was having difficulty latching baby on the right breast. The baby was calmed down with a gloved finger and then placed STS in a football hold. After several attempts the baby was not able to latch on effectively and appeared more and more upset. The pt used a 20 mm nipple shield and the baby latched for just a few moments but was still having difficulty. A 24 mm nipple shield was then used and baby latched much better and was suckling better at the breast without difficulty. I encouraged both the pt and the FOB to call back at any time breastfeeding support is needed or questions arise.,1
"Lactation assistance and support: I assisted this pt with positioning and deep latch techniques after she communicated that baby is on her breast for an extended amount of time but wanting to continue nursing frequently. I educated her on the need to perform breast massage and hand expression prior to breast feeding. She was able to perform a return demonstration appropriately. STS benefits to mom and baby were discussed and reccommended as much as possible. Baby was positioned in the football hold and latch asymmetrically with notable nutritive sucking. The details of a deep latch were noted including a flanged mouth, chin embedded in the breast and small areola skin visible on top of the breast. The pt denies any pain with this breastfeeding event. Upon examination her breasts had no signs of redness or cracking. I provided her with the [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] Breastfeeding booklet and highlighted the contact numbers for community resources and lactation F/U after D/C. I also informed her about the mothers breastfeeding support group and provided her with an invitation. I left her with instructions to call for any questions or concerns with breastfeeding.",1

"ATTENDING OPERATIVE NOTE   Date of Surgery: [**DATE**]  Preoperative Diagnosis: 1.IUP@35 4/7 wks 2. Dichorionic-diamniotic twins 3. PPROM 4. Severe pre-eclampsia 5. Failed induction Postoperative Diagnosis: Same  Operation Performed: Low transverse cesarean   Surgeon: [**NAME**]  Assistants: [**NAME**] (MS-[**ID**]), Jewett (MS-1)  Anesthesiologist: Euliano  Anesthesia: Epidural   Procedure:   Prior to the start of surgery, a time-out was taken, and the patient's identity and operative procedure were verified.  The peritoneal cavity then was entered without complication through a  Pfannenstiel incision.  The lower uterine segment was identified, and the bladder flap was created by sharp and blunt dissection.  A horizontal incision was made in the lower uterine segment, and the first infant was delivered from a cephalic presentation without difficulty.  The baby was a  2290 gram  male and had Apgar scores of 9 and 7 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The second infant was also delivered from a cephalic position. This baby was a female who weighed 1957 grams. Her Apgar scores were 9 and 9. The placenta was removed by gentle traction on the umbilical cord.  It was intact, and the cord had 3 vessels.  The myometrium then was closed in two layers using continuous sutures of 0-Vicryl.  The pericolic gutters were carefully irrigated.  The fascial edges then were re-approximated with two continuous sutures of 0-Vicryl.  The wound was  irrigated, and the lower half of the subcutaneous tissue was re-approximated with a running suture of 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin edges were re-approximated with an intracuticular suture of 3-0 Monocryl.  The estimated blood loss during surgery was 800 ml, and the patient received 1500 ml of Plasmalyte solution. Urine output during surgery was 100 mL.  At the conclusion of the procedure, the sponge count and needle count were correct.  The neonate was transported to the newborn nursery in good condition, and the mother was transported to the recovery room, also in good condition.  The patient received an injection of cefazolin plus azithromycin to reduce the risk of postoperative infection.  [**NAME**], M.D. Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology",0

"Lactation support and assistance: The pt was pumping with the dual hospital grade breast pump when I visited her this morning.

I returned later to find baby in the crib and the pt waiting to pump again at 1000. We talked about breast massage and the benefits for stimulation and engorgement prevention. She was able to demonstrate the appropriate techniques for both hand expression and breast massage. The baby was demonstrating advance feeding cues so the pt agreed to my assistance with latching baby with a 24 mm nipple shield. Baby was successfully latched deeply and asymmetrically to the right breast which was very full and firm. Colostrum was easily expressed and applied to the nipple shield in advance of the latch. Dr [**NAME**] and the peds team confirmed on exam that baby has a posterior tight frenulum and the pt agreed to a frenotomy to be performed when the circumcision is done.

Mother and baby were assisted this morning by lactation nurse [**NAME**] who noted ""very sore reddened nipples,"" and baby subsequently underwent a frenotomy by Dr. [**NAME**].    [**NAME**] is a 22 y/o primipara who gave birth to her infant female via SVD on [**CONTACT_PHONE**] at 5:52pm.  GA by dates: 40w 1d.  GA by exam: 40 weeks AGA.  Birth weight:  3380g (7lb 7.2oz).  APGARS [**DATE**].  Pitocin was used as a pre/perinatal medication.  Baby was resuscitated by suctioning, oxygen, and PPV.    Maternal history:  Depression managed with Zoloft and Buspar.    Maternal breast assessment:  Breasts are medium in size, closely spaced, and somewhat pendulous.  The right breast is softer than the L, and mother reports baby just finished nursing on the rt.  The L breast was heavy prior to the feed, becoming softer as the feeding progressed, and we discussed the mother's early onset of her second milk coming in re: Lactogenesis II [L2] at less than 24 hours postpartum.  The nipple anatomy is quite short on the right, and the left nipple is flat though protractile to a short length via gentle tactile nipple stimulation.  There are pronounced abrasions to both nipples, more significant on the L.  Infant assessment for feeding readiness:  Babe was nursing at the right breast upon my arrival, and displayed hand-to-mouth behavior and licking of lips prior to subsequently nursing on the L breast.    Feeding assessment: Due to the extent of the mother's nipple damage as well as the flat nipple on the L, a 24mm nipple shield was used during the entire feed in cross cradle hold and cradle hold on the L.  Mother rated her pain level as ""7"" on a 0 to 10 pain scale after the initial latch at the one-minute mark, and after the baby had been nursing well over ten minutes.    Patient teaching:  Mother was advised that short and/or flat nipple anatomy is a risk factor for nipple damage, though not all mothers with short and/or flat nipple anatomy experience nipple soreness and/or nipple trauma.  However, the mother was advised that the shorter nipple can come into greater contact with the baby's gumline (upper alveolar ridge) and/or hard palate for all or part of a feeding, and that a deep latch is important for protecting the mother's nipple integrity, even with a nipple shield.      A USP-modified lanolin product with teaching was provided by mother's RN at my request, and I also asked the RN to provide the mother with breast shells for keeping her nipples protected from friction while the nipple wounds heal.  The breast shells also provide ample space so that all of the lanolin product can stay on the nipples, rather than much of the product being absorbed by bra fabric.  Mother was advised that if her nipple wounds become more painful that what she can tolerate, she may express her milk for any missed feedings in order to support her milk production while her nipple wounds continue to heal.  Mother was encouraged to call for assistance as desired, and to call with any questions or concerns.      [**NAME**], RN BSN IBCLC Lactation Consultant",1

Will send placenta to pathology for further evaluation.   Complications:  Upon arrival to room, Neonate had delivered with RN assistance and was vigorously crying. Umbilical cord was clamped and neonate was taken to warmer for RN assessment. Cord gases and cord were collected.  At this time IV pitocin was started and gentle traction was place on cord. Placenta was not separating, so 1st degree right labial laceration was repaired with three stitches of 3-0 vicryl. Left labia was noted to have a large (~5 cm by 5 cm) Bartholin's Cyst which per pt report has been stable for years and has never been infected. No erythema or area of fluctuance noted within cyst.    Excess membranes were noted at the perineum. Gentle traction was continued on cord in addition to fundal massage, but placenta was slow to separate.  Placenta slowly delivered and was noted to be intact. At this time a large gush of blood followed delivery of placenta. I attempted to perform uterine massage but was unable to palpate fundus. I performed bimanual uterine massage and immediately noted a complete uterine inversion.   Pitocin was stopped. Dr. [**NAME**] and anesthesia were called to bedside STAT.  I attempted to apply direct pressure directly upward with my fist in attempt to revert the uterus. Sublingual Nitroglycerin was called for and two doses of subinginal nitro was given by Dr. [**NAME**]. Uterus still would not revert. 0.25 mg IM Terbutaline was given.

Liveborn infant male weighing 822 grams with Apgars of 2 and 2 and 7.  Indication: [**NAME**] is a 46 y.o. female para 0100 who presented with cervical funneling seen on ultrasound at 24w6d.  She progressed to 4/c/-2 and fetus was found to be in frank breech presentation.    Procedure: After satisfactory anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped in a routine fashion for abdominal surgery. Time-out confirmed patient and procedure. The abdomen was entered with a Pfannensteil approach. Skin incision was made with scapel; this was carried down to the underlying layer of fascia and this was scored in the midline. The rectus muscles were separated in the midline and the peritoneum was entered with sharp dissection while maintaining visualization of the bowel and bladder. The superior aspect of the fascial incision was grasped upward and the underlying rectus muscle was dissected away with a combination of sharp and blunt dissection.  Attention was then turned to the inferior aspect which was grasped upward and underlying rectus muscles were dissected away with sharp dissection. A low classical incision was made in the muscular portion of the uterus with a scalpel and extended with bandage scissors.   Amniotic fluid was clear. The above described infant was delivered from the breech presentation. The cord was clamped and the cord was cut and the baby handed to the pediatrician who was present for delivery. Blood for gases and DNA was obtained. The placenta was manually extracted.   The uterus was cleared of clots and debris. The uterus was exteriorized. The uterus was closed with a four layer closure.  Initial layer was a 0-monocryl locking layer; the second and third layers were an imbricating layer of 0-monocryl.  The fourth layer was a 2-0 vicryl baseball stitch to reapproximate the serosa.  The uterus was replaced into the patient's abdomen. The hysterotomy was hemostatic as was the fascia and rectus muscles.   The fascia was closed with 0-Vicryl starting at the angle and running in a continuous fashion. The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated with normal saline and was found to be hemostatic. The skin was closed with with 0-monocryl. Dermabond was applied. The vagina was cleared of clots. All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.   [**NAME**]",0

The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfanenstiel incision.  A bladder flap was created.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with traction.  The amniotic fluid was clear.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood was obtained for analysis.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.  The uterus was exteriorized, and the uterine incision was closed in two layers, the first a running suture of 0 Monocryl and the second a running, imbricating suture of 0 Monocryl.    The right fallopian tube was identified to its fimbriated end and a modified Pomeroy tubal ligation was performed. Adequate hemostasis was assured.  The exact same procedure was performed on the opposite side after identifying that tube to its fimbriated end; again, adequate hemostasis was assured.  The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity.  Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision and in the subfascial area.  The peritoneum was closed and the muscle re-approximated using 2-0 Vicryl. The fascia was closed with a two sutures of 0 Vicryl starting at each corner and meeting in the middle.  The subcutaneous tissue was closed with a running suture of 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with a running subcuticular closure of 3-0 Monocryl.  Benzoin, Steri-Strips, and a sterile dressing were applied to the incision.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.
