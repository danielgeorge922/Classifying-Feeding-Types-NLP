Day 1 postpartum with pumping in progress. H/O unsuccessful breast milk production with 1st baby 18 months ago. Desires to produce sufficient milk for twin babies born yesterday @ 36wga. Initiated UL breast pumping on DOB w/ Medela Symphony. Breast pump shield size increased at this time based on PE of maternal breast to 30mm diam. Discussed benefit of pumping breasts every 2-3 hours for 15-20 min to ensure adequate breast stimulation. PE of maternal breasts yields dx of BL nipple/areolar edema. Advised patient to pump today and tomorrow to bring milk in and to bottle feed infants breast colostrum and formula = total feed amount of 20ml.
