Mom has been breastfeeding and bottle-feeding. She was giving a bottle for one feed and breastfeeding the next feed.  Mom instructed the risk of her milk supply decreasing . And the importance of putting the baby onto the breast to stimulate them. Mom's nipples are flat, pumping initiated and instructed mom to use her pump to pull the nipples out to help the baby with the latch, I noticed mom had a nipple shield 24mm. I will help mom for the next feed.
