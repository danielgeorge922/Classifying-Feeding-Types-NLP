Received a referral this morning stating that Meridian had accepted patient last night for admission, but the MD's did not feel she was ready at that time, but is now. Called Meridian. They requested updated information including orders. Faxed over all the information. Unclear as to whether they will have a bed for patient. Meridian will notify us when one becomes available. No further services at this time. Please call if needed. Patient is aware that she will probably be discharged today.
