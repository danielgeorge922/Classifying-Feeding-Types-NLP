Dr. [**NAME**] and myself were present to discuss with the patient and inform her that the patient would not be able to have her BTI during this admission. Due to her fevers this admission she is at increased risk of pelvic infection.  She declined other forms of birth control and plan to schedule her BTI.  Plan to d/c in am if patient remains afebrile.
