Assisted pt to WC & transported her to NICU3 to visit newborn.  She was escorted by 2 RN's ([**NAME**] RN & R.Roughton RN) & was joined by her mother.  Pt visited with newborn in unit with both RN's & her mom by her side.  The NICU nurses encouraged questions from the pt & her mom.  She was also encouraged to come visit the baby as much as she likes.  Pt touched the baby & was weepy.  Her mom took a few pictures.
