I met with MOB at bedside.  I reviewed medical records.  MOB is 22 years old and this is her fourth child.  She has two sons, DOB [**DATE**] & [**DATE**], and a daughter, DOB [**DATE**].  She is enrolled in Medicaid/Medipass. She has purchased necessities in preparation for baby's arrival.  She is aware of SIDS and Shaken Baby training.  She was late to prenatal care.  No other social concerns.
