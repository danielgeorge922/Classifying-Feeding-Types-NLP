Mom is breastfeeding on demand and allowing the baby to sty on the breast as long as the baby wants, discharge instructions given. I helped mom latch the baby onto the breast in a football hold and the baby has good latch and a nutritive suck. Mom is on WIC and refused the Healthy Start program. Mom states she has a lot of breast feeding support from her family.
