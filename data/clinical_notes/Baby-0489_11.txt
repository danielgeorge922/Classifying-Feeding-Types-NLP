After delivery all family members present were tearful, smiling & hugging each other.  The pt requested that the baby be cleaned off before giving to her which was done.  When pt received the baby she was tearful & smiling down at her.  She spoke to her softly & made eye contact.  FOB was at her side & she gave the newborn to him to hold.  Other family members took turns holding her.  All of them were smiling at her while holding her closely & speaking to her softly.  Pt began to drink fluids.  She is currently breastfeeding the baby who has latched on successfully.  Will obtain another set of VS & let baby cont to nurse.  Then will take her to NBN for transition prior to transporting them to 95.
