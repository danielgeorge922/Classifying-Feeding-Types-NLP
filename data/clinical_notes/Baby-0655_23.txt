Please see previous social work services progress note for continuity.  Social work continuing to follow MOB during this admission to assist with adoption plan.  Met privately with MOB who reports feeling overwhelmed with visitors, and is requesting to have perspective adoptive family and her friend Ann visit only until 3pm today, at which point she would like to spend some time alone with newborn.  She reported she would only like her 2 male visitors -- FOB and current boyfriend -- to visit at any time, unless she makes a special request for any other visits.  Social work informed prospective adoptive parents and friend [**NAME**] who appeared to appreciate MOB's request and verbalized their plan to respect her wishes.  Charge nurse [**NAME**] was present for most of that conversation and will be available for support as needed.    Social work plans to remain involved.
