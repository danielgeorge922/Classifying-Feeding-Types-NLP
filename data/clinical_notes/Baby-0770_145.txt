I met with MOB, Sharelle, and father, Sebastian in private.  Sharelle gave permission for me to speak in front of the father, [**NAME**].  She admitted smoking marijuana throughout the pregnancy.  She denied any legal issues or past DCF involvement.  According to the medical chart she smoked marijuana daily sometimes multiple times.  Sharelle said that she has not used marijuana since she has been hospitalized and does not plan to use marijuana again.   She became irate when I informed her that I would make a referral to the DCF hotline.  I telephoned the abuse hotline and a report was generated by [**NAME**] ID # [**ID**].  Please document any concerns in the medical chart.  I will be available to answer questions.
