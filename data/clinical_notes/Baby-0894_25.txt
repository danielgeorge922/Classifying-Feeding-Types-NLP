Social work met with MOB following a routine chart screening due to multiple social concerns, including history of domestic violence with FOB, 2 inpatient admissions due to suicidal gestures, and undocumented custody of 1 child.      A review of PNC records indicate MOB has a restraining order against her spouse, [**NAME**], during this pregnancy for physical violence.   When social work initially met with MOB she was accompanied bedside by her spouse, [**NAME**].  Social work did not elicit information re: domestic violence (DV) due to concerns for patient and newborn safety.  However, they did report residing together in a home they have lived in for one week, and that spouse was involved and supportive.  They were not able to provide a physical address for where they are residing.    MOB reports her "aunt" is in the process of adopting her 2y/o child and denies any involvement with DCF.  She reports she was "too young" to care for a child, but was unable to provide any other information.    MOB reports a current stable mood and denies history of post partum depression.    Social work later met with MOB and her grandmother, [**NAME**], while FOB briefly left the room.  Social work confirmed that MOB does still have a restraining order in place against FOB.  Social work provided anticipatory guidance to DCF involvement and MOB appeared to understand the reason for their involvement.  Her grandmother appeared very supportive of helping MOB develop and alternate, and safer discharge plan than residing with FOB.    Due to concerns regarding a safe discharge of newborn, a report was made to and accepted by FL Abuse Hotline ([**CONTACT_PHONE**]-ABUSE) reporter Christen ID#[**ID**] with an immediate response indicated.  [**LOCATION_CITY**] County DCF protective investigator [**NAME**] ([**CONTACT_PHONE**]) initiated investigation bedside and was accompanied by UPD and security.  UPD determined FOB, [**NAME**] Fox was in violation of a restraining order that MOB placed approximately one month ago, and he was ultimately arrested without incident.    After an extensive interview with MOB and her grandmother, [**NAME**], it was determined that DCF will not request to shelter newborn, but instead will place services in the home.  MOB has agreed to reside on the property of her grandmother, and will not allow FOB to visit.  She has agreed to a psychiatric and substance abuse assessment at Meridian and in-home parenting support and education with The Nurturing Program.  She has also been referred to Healthy Start.  DCF plans to meet with FOB at the [**LOCATION_CITY**] County Jail to update him and let him know the plan.    Although it appears that DCF does not plan to shelter at this time, please see social work prior to newborn discharge.
