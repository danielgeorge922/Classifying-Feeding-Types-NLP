I met with MOB in her room on Unit 95. MOB is known to me from sw involvement while she was admitted to L&D (see sw note from [**DATE**]). MOB noted that her three older children are in the care of a family member, but she is not yet certain how long they will be able to remain in the family member's care. She also expressed uncertainty re: DCF case and additional support that may be offered. MOB denied significant history with the Department. Of note, DCF investigator, [**NAME**], who met with MOB on [**DATE**] reported no concerns re: MOB.   MOB advised that, depending on the length of baby's hospitalization, she may need to return to [**LOCATION_CITY**] to provide care for her children and visit her baby as she is able. We discussed RMH and MOB requested placement on the waiting list, advising that older children may stay with her there until they have to return to school from the winter break on [**DATE**]. I placed MOB in the list and provided guidance for calling daily to confirm her reservation.  MOB lost a baby to SIDS in [**DATE**]. She became tearful discussing this, advising that he had been asleep in his crib when she found him and called 911. MOB shared has mostly worked through the grief of this loss, but still feels sad at times, including his birthday and the date of his death. I validated this emotional response and provided brief supportive counseling. We also discussed increased risk for PPD given this loss and the stress of her baby's condition and hospitalization. I encouraged follow up with her OB/GYN as needed should symptoms arise. MOB is also enrolled in Healthy Start and has counseling resources available through this program.  MOB has very limited support at this time. She advised that all of her family in [**LOCATION_CITY**] are busy with work and their own children. MOB also noted that she and [**NAME**], are not in a relationship at this time, although she does anticipate he will be involved to some extent in baby's life. It is unlikely that FOB will be able to come sign birth certificate, but MOB stated that she would like him to be on it and that she also intends to pursue child support. I provided guidance for requesting birth certificate amendment.   MOB received limited prenatal care due to transportation issues. We discussed the importance of resolving transportation barriers so that baby can be seen at all recommended medical appointments. I provided information re: Medicaid transportation for this. MOB also reported a plan to obtain a vehicle upon receipt of her income tax return.   MOB resides with her three children and the family is supported by income from MOB's job, child support and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. MOB is enrolled in Healthy Start and is planning to breast feed. I discussed breastfeeding meal voucher program and will provide vouchers upon her d/c. I also provided information re: SSI. MOB had questions re: her baby's condition and whether "he'll be disabled". I provided general information re: criteria for SSI and encouraged MOB to discuss specific medical questions with the medical team.  I will continue to follow with the team.  [**NAME**], LCSW
