This note was copied from the chart of BOY/[**NAME**]. Lactation:  Consult per RN and mother's request for newborn with anterior vs. complete cleft lip on the L (unilateral) [please see pediatric assessment on [**DATE**]].  Mother is [**NAME**], a 25 y/o G1P1001 with negative and confirmed serologies, who was GBS+ and treated with ampicillin x 4.  Mother gave birth to her son on [**DATE**] at 12:35pm via spontaneous vaginal delivery.  GA by dates: 39w2d.  GA by exam: pending weeks, AGA by weight.  Birth weight: 3039g.  APGARS [**DATE**].     The mother's room was filled with happy extended family members who soon departed for the consult.  FOB was present for the consultation.   Mother reported that she experienced some biting during baby's earlier feed.   Mother plans to be a stay-at-home mother for an indefinite period of time.   Maternal breast assessment:  Breasts are medium to medium-large in size, closely spaced, and symmetrical with moderate density.  Nipple anatomy is well-defined and well-protracted, nonreddened and intact.    Infant assessment for feeding readiness:  Baby was awake and alert, licking lips and opening mouth.    Feeding assessment:  Mother was assisted in positioning her baby on the left breast in cross-cradle and cradle holds.  Baby displayed some brief initial on-and-off behavior on this first breast for less than one minute, and a 24mm nipple shield was provided to support the baby's ability to latch, although baby did not latch with the nipple shield.  Baby was returned to the breast without a nipple shield, then was soon able to sustain the latch with appropriately rhythmic suckling x 10 minutes.  The L breast was palpably softer after the feed.   Following a short 2-minute nap by the baby, the mother was assisted in positioning her baby in the cross-cradle hold and cradle hold on the right breast.  Baby latched quickly onto the second breast (the right), and the baby nursed for another 6 minutes into a deeply relaxed state re: complete hand and arm extension with limpness.  The mother's left breast was palpably softer than the right (the baby had nursed longer on the first breast, which was the left breast).  Baby displayed appropriate jaw excursions during the feed at both breasts, and there was frequent audible swallowing heard while baby nursed from each breast.    Patient teaching:  Mother was advised to offer the breast to her baby at least 8 to 12 times every 24 hours, in response to baby's early hunger cues of licking lips, hand-to-mouth, and rooting behavior.  The [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] breastfeeding handbook was provided, and we reviewed baby's reported one urine and one stool thus far as having met Day 1's goals for output per the handbook's feeding-and-diaper-change chart.  Mother was commended for baby's beautiful feeding, and the baby's father expressed his happiness in regard to how well his son had nursed.  Mother was encouraged to call for assistance as desired, and to call with any questions or concerns.  [**NAME**], RN BSN IBCLC Lactation Consultant
