This note was copied from the chart of BOY/[**NAME**]. Lactation:  Follow-up consult by parents' request for fussy baby not latching.  Baby had been sleepy today following circumcision, although mother reports one brief 4-minute feed as well as one 40-minute feed post-circumcision.    Maternal breast assessment:  Breasts are medium to large in size, closely spaced, heavy, and asymmetrical re: L breast distinctly smaller than the right.  Mother reports that baby's recent 40-minute feeding took place on this now-smaller breast.    Feeding assessment:  After placing the baby in skin-to-skin contact with the mother, the mother was assisted in positioning her baby in football hold on the right breast, although only minimal guidance was needed by the mother for positioning her baby to feed.  Mother was then assisted in helping her baby with latch, and baby was able to sustain the latch after a few unsuccessful attempts, then displayed rhythmic suckling with audible swallows.  Baby nursed for 10+ minutes into a deeply relaxed state re: limp arms and deep sleep. Baby did not require the support of any nipple shield during this feed.    Patient teaching:  Light breast compression was discussed with the mother in order to help baby sustain the latch more quickly, and we also discussed the frequent loss of latch and difficulty with latch following the use of an artificial nipple, and particularly the early use of an artificial nipple.  Parents acknowledged that baby has used a pacifier, and the grandmother was holding a pacifier attached to a soft toy animal.  We discussed the frequent skill decay for breastfeeding re: difficulty with latch following the use of an artificial nipple, particularly during a baby's skill acquisition for latch, since babies learn to correlate the smell, touch, and taste of the maternal nipple with suckling and the receipt of milk, versus learning to correlate the smell, touch, and taste of an artificial nipple with suckling.  Parents and grandmother were open to this discussion in a highly positive manner.    Mother was encouraged to offer baby the breast in early hunger, when latch is easier to learn.  Mother was further encouraged to call for assistance as desired, and to call with any questions or concerns.  [**NAME**], RN BSN IBCLC Lactation Consultant
