Please see all previous SW notes for continuity.  SW has been speaking with bedside nurse throughout the day. Nurse reported that MOB has been able to care for baby at bedside most of the day. Because FOB is not comfortable with baby being discharged home to him and MOB is currently able to bond with and care for baby at bedside, baby will remain in hospital.   SW contacted DCF Investigator Roscoe Docum ([**CONTACT_PHONE**]) who stated that baby can be discharged home with MOB. SW talked with Mr. [**NAME**] about FOB's refusal to take baby home upon discharge and Mr. [**NAME**] stated that he felt FOB was acting in best interest of baby if FOB truly did not feel that he could provide adequate care by himself (he has not experience with babies).  At this time, plan is for baby to be discharged with MOB. However, nurse contacted Dr. [**NAME**] this afternoon and Dr. [**NAME**] stated that there is "no discharge plan in sight" at this point as MOB is currently "unstable."    SW will continue to assess this situation for discharge needs as they arise.
