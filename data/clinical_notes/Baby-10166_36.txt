CORD GASES: (Arterial)  Lab Results  Component Value Date   PHCORDA 7.27 [**DATE**]     (Venous):  Lab Results  Component Value Date   PHCORDV 7.35 [**DATE**]    SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY: placenta   INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 30 y.o. female P1102 with history of chronic hypertension (on Aldomet 500 mg BID), and history of prior cesarean x1 for breech presentation who presented from clinic at 36w1d for new onset severe range blood pressures. Upon arrival to L&D she had multiple severe range blood pressures which required IV treatment. She was started on magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis, and decision was made to proceed with induction of labor for CHTN with superimposed preeclampsia. Patient desired a vaginal birth after cesarean, so she was counseled appropriately consented, and started with a foley bulb induction of labor given initial cervical exam closed/thick/high. During induction, patient was examined and fetal position had changed to breech. Decision was made to take patient to operating room for repeat cesarean given fetal malpresentation.   DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfannenstiel incision. The incision was taken down to the level of the fascia which was incised in the midline. The incision was extended laterally in either direction over the rectus muscles. The fascia was dissected off the rectus muscle superiorly and then inferiorly. The rectus muscle was divided sharply with a scalpel. The peritoneum was entered sharply in a clear space sharply with Metzenbaum scissors. A bladder flap was created and the bladder blade was repositioned. A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with the surgeon's fingers. The amniotic fluid was clear upon rupture.  The above described infant was delivered from the Breech presentation.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood was obtained for analysis.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.  The uterus was exteriorized, and the uterine incision was closed in two layers, the first a running suture of 0 Monocryl and the second a running, imbricating suture of 0 Monocryl. Two figure of eight stitches of 3-0 vicryl were placed along uterine incision for additional hemostasis.    The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity.  Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision, posterior to the bladder, and in the subfascial area.  The fascia was closed with two sutures of 0 Vicryl beginning from either end of the incision and meeting in the midportion.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and closed with a running suture of 3-0 chromic.  The skin was closed with a running subcuticular closure of 3-0 Monocryl.   Dermabond was applied to the incision.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.   [**NAME**], MD
