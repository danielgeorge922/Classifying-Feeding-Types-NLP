SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY:  Segments from each tube  INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 40 y.o. P2103, 1 days status post a SVD@ 38w3d who after informed consent, requests permanent sterilization in the form of bilateral tubal interruption.  DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  The infraumbilical regional was infiltrated with 0.25% Marcaine.  The abdomen was entered with a transverse incision below the umbilicus.   The left fallopian tube was identified to its fimbriated end and a defect was made in a relatively avascular portion of the mesosalpinx underlying the mid isthmic portion of the tube.  A segment of the mid isthmic portion of the tube was ligated with two sutures of 0 Chromic suture and the intervening portion of the tube excised and handed off the field; adequate hemostasis was assured.  The exact same procedure was performed on the opposite side after identifying that tube to its fimbriated end; again, adequate hemostasis was assured.  The fascia was closed with a running suture of O-Vicryl.  The skin was closed with a subcuticular stitch of 3-0 Monocryl. Dermabond and bandage applied.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in satisfactory condition.    [**NAME**], MD
