This note was copied from the chart of BOY/[**NAME**]. Lactation:  Consult by RN request for this preterm infant's first breastfeeding practice session today.  Mother has been using a medical-grade electric breastpump in her patient room, and reports that she obtained drops in the bottom of the pump bottle from her most recent pumping today.     Maternal breast assessment:  Breasts are medium in size, closely spaced, pendulous and soft. There is a high level of elasticity in the areolae.  Nipple anatomy is well-defined and protractile.    Infant assessment for feeding readiness:  Infant was asleep beside the mother's breast upon my arrival, although RN reported baby had been displaying hand-to-mouth behavior several minutes prior.  Within five minutes of my arrival, baby stirred and displayed hunger cues re: rooting behavior and hand-to-mouth behavior.    Feeding assessment:  Mother was assisted in positioning her baby in the cross-cradle hold at the right breast.  Baby slept at the breast for five minutes, then roused, and mother was assisted in guiding baby in to the breast for the oral grasp/latch.  Baby was on-and-off the breast in a common early learning display, prior to learning how to achieve the oral grasp at the breast.  In less than 5 minutes, baby was able to sustain the latch and displayed appropriate rhythmic suckling with appropriate sucking bursts.  Baby nursed for approximately 30 minutes on the right breast, with occasional loss of latch every 5 to 10 minutes, then was assisted in successful re-latching.  After 30 minutes on the right breast, baby was assisted with positioning and latch in the football/clutch hold at the L breast.  Baby latched quickly on the second breast and nursed in an appropriate rhythmic manner, losing the latch only twice, and relatching without assistance on the second loss of the latch.  Baby nursed for another 15 minutes, then entered a state of deep relaxation and sleep, with the outer arm and fingers extended and limp.    Patient teaching:  Mother was advised to continue to express her milk after nursing, for at least 8 pumpings every 24 hours toward a full daily volume of 800ml that will likely be achieved by Day 14 or very soon thereafter.  In spite of this baby's early breastfeeding skill that was displayed today, preterm infants have less buccal fat pad tissue than term infants, and may not transfer adequate volumes from the breast until another pound of weight is gained, for example. (The newborn's buccal fat pads must contain adequate amounts of fat in order to babies to create enough vacuum pressure ["suction"] for adequate milk transfer.  Building and maintaining a full volume of 800ml of expressed milk daily is a standard recommendation to mothers of NICU babies, until the infant can exclusively breastfeed and gain weight well.  This pumping regimen is considered protective of the mother's milk supply, until the preterm infant displays the consistent ability to transfer adequate volumes of milk.  In this manner, the preterm infant is also protected by an abundant maternal milk supply.    Parents are to obtain a fax number for sending a prescription to their insurance company for a medical-grade electric breastpump.  The medical prescription has already been provided today to the parents via RN and nurse practitioner. Parents have also been given the contact information for local resources regarding a pump rental.  Even though the mother has already been provided with a high-end retail breastpump (Medela Pump In Style) by her insurance company, a medical-grade/hospital-grade electric breastpump is the standard of care for building full volume when there is daily separation between mother and baby, as in hospitalization.     At 1:45pm today, mother was able to express 3ml from the medical-grade electric breastpump in her patient room, and this was celebrated.  I had advised the mother earlier today to practice increasing the vaccum pressure ["suction"] as high as she could comfortably tolerate with the pump, and both parents were delighted with this marked increase in volume.
