Liveborn infant female weighing 3838 grams with Apgars of 8 and 9.  Indication: [**NAME**] is a 25 y.o. female para 1001 who had a prior cesarean delivery x1 and declined trial of labor.    Procedure: After satisfactory anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped in a routine fashion for abdominal surgery. Time-out confirmed patient and procedure. The abdomen was entered with a Pfannensteil approach.  The superior aspect of the fascial incision was grasped upward and the underlying rectus muscle was dissected away with a combination of sharp and blunt dissection.  Attention was then turned to the inferior aspect which was grasped upward and underlying rectus muscles were dissected away with sharp dissection.  The rectus muscles were separated in the midline and the peritoneum was entered with blunt dissection while maintaining visualization of the bowel and bladder.  A bladder flap was made.  A low transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and extended laterally.  Amniotic fluid was clear. The above described infant was delivered from the cephalic presentation. The cord was clamped and the cord was cut and the baby handed to the pediatrician who was present for delivery. Blood for gases and DNA was obtained. The placenta was delivered with cord traction.   The uterus was cleared of clots and debris. The uterus was exteriorized. The uterus was closed with a two layer closure; initial layer was a 0-vicryl locking layer; the second layer was an imbricating layer of 0-vicryl.  The uterus was replaced into the patient's abdomen. The hysterotomy was hemostatic as was the fascia and rectus muscles.  The fascia was closed with 0-Vicryl starting at the angle and running in a continuous fashion. The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated with normal saline and was found to be hemostatic. The subcutaneous tissue was reapproximated with 3-0 vicryl.  The skin was closed with with 0-monocryl. Dermabond was applied. The vagina was cleared of clots. All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.    [**NAME**]
