This note was copied from the chart of BOY/[**NAME**]. Lactation:  Two visits were provided today, with patient teaching on early to advanced hunger cues and offering baby the breast during early hunger, for easiest learning by baby.  Mother states baby can latch and nurse on the right breast, and RN reports baby has nursed independently on the right, but the mother states, "He comes off in a few minutes and cries."  The mother stated her perception that baby is still hungry, and we discussed again offering the same breast and/or offering the other breast, and continuing to go back and forth between breasts until baby is full, with the rationale of multiple milk releases from the breast.  Female visitors were present during my second visit, and one of the visitors was holding baby in one arm and a bottle of formula in the other hand.    Mother denied nipple soreness or nipple pain with breastfeeding thus far.  We discussed the common learning behavior in newborns that follows the use of an artificial nipple, and particularly the early use of an artificial nipple re: difficulty with latch and/or sucking at the breast.  Mother was encouraged to offer baby the breast in response to baby's early hunger cues, and to request any needed assistance from the nursing staff as well as the breastfeeding specialists, until baby is nursing well for all feeds as the mother wishes.    Mother was provided with a pump kit at her request and at the request of the nursing staff, and a pump demonstration of the manual pump was also provided.  The baby is reported to now be nursing well on one breast, and mother was reassured that many babies learn how to latch onto one breast a day or more before learning how to latch onto the other breast.
