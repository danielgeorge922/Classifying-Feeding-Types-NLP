Lactation F/U note: I returned to see this pt per her request to assist with latching and positioning. The baby was STS and readily latched on with the cross cradle position and some finger stimulation. A wide open mouth was obtained with the nipple to nose technique and baby was brought close and latched immediately. Deep sucks and rhythmic jaw movements were noted and milk transfer was observed and the pt stated she could feel the deep sucking but denied any pain or burning. I commended her technique and the successful latch which was obtained without the aide of the nipple shield. The pt was encouraged to continue feeding the baby and to stimulate him intermittently if he falls asleep with physical touch and breast compressions. Continue to support and assist as needed.
