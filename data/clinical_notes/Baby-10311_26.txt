Please see previous SW notes for continuity.  SW received referral, re: Husband of MOB ([**NAME**]) stating "there is a man in my wife's room and I think he is going to steal my baby."  SW first met with MOB's husband (not the man who was caring for MOB and baby yesterday during SW assessment), who stated that the man who has been in his wife's room taking care of her wants to take away his baby.  SW met with MOB privately. SW asked MOB about the two men. MOB stated that the man ([**NAME**]) who has been helping to care for her and baby is the father of her 8 y/o son, not her husband. MOB stated that her husband works all the time and she needs someone in the room with her to help with her care and baby's care. She stated that [**NAME**] took the entire week off of work to help her. She also stated that she has been living in Jose's house for most of the pregnancy because he is then able to parent their son and help take care of her.  SW asked MOB if she has any concerns that [**NAME**] would try to "steal" her baby. MOB stated that is ridiculous. She stated that [**NAME**] is a good father to her son and is a good friend to her. SW explained to MOB that her husband has concerns that [**NAME**] would like to take the baby for his own. MOB stated that there is friction between the two men. She stated that there is a slight possibility that [**NAME**] is the father of the baby, but she does not think so. She asked about paternity tests. SW informed MOB that paternity tests are not done in the hospital, but by outside organizations.   SW suggested to MOB that she may want to tell the two men that they cannot be at the hospital at the same time.  SW met with MOB's husband ([**NAME**]) and informed him that MOB has no concerns about baby's safety around Jose. SW explained to [**NAME**] that the hospital staff cannot remove a visitor that is not considered a safety concern by MOB. SW encouraged [**NAME**] to discuss his concerns with MOB.  SW returned to MOB's room to request some information and MOB stated that she wanted Jean to leave. SW informed [**NAME**] that he needs to leave if MOB is requesting that he leave. SW instructed MOB to contact her nurse if [**NAME**] will not leave as requested.   SW will continue to follow as needed. If there are any safety concerns, please call security.
