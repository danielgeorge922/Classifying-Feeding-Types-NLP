Progress Note  Neurology saw pt and reccommended diagnostic/therapeutic LP. Neurology does not do these unless the patient is on their in service. Our anesthesia attending on this evening will not do it. I spoke with neurology and they said that interventional radiology-neuro does these. I placed a consult in EPIC, they do not come overnight, and will need to be called in the morning.   [**NAME**] MD
