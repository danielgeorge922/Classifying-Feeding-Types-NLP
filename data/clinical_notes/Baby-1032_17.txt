I helped mom latch the baby onto the breast in a football hold the baby has a good latch and a nutritive suck . Mom has short nipples but the baby has a good latch. Hunger cues reviewed with mom . Mom instructed to breastfeed the baby every 1 1/2  To 2 hours and allow the baby to stay on the breast as long as she wants, mom also instructed to put the baby skin to skin. Mom encouraged to call the office if she has any concerns.
