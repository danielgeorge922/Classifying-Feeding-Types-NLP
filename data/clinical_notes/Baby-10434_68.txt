With rounds pt was in w/c wanting to go downstairs.  Explained to pt that a page is into the Dr to allow her to go downstairs.  Pt voiced understanding.  Dr [**NAME**] called and said she was in the ER with another pt and would be over ASAP.  When I went to pt room to give her this information pt was not in room or on the unit.
