Assumed c/o pt.  EM x 2 in place & recording.  Pt resting comfortably at this time & chatting with her sister.  She said she was happy to see me & told me about her frustrations with the staff & POC today.  She said "I showed out but I was just so frustrated of being told different things by everybody who came in here".  I told her that we just wants what's best for her & her baby.  She said she understands that & it's also what she wants.  She said she just feels like everyone is on a different page with what's planned for her.  She has other children that have missed two weeks of school while she's been hospitalized.  She said she lives in [**LOCATION_CITY**] & the kids are staying with her mom in [**LOCATION_CITY**] with no transportation to school.  Pt said she still has a headache that has been unrelieved by tylenol or fioricet.  She denies pain, bleeding, gush of fluids & states understanding to notify me right away if any of these things occur.
