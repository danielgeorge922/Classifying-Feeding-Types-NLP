Please see previous CM and SW notes for continuity of care.  While covering primary SW this SW met with MOB at bedside of baby, in NICU II, to complete an initial assessment.  MOB was bonding with the baby and SW did not want to interrupt this important time so the MOB stated she will call the SW when she goes back to her room.  SW will follow up with the MOB to complete assessment at that time.
