Lactation F/U note: I returned to provide assistance as the pt called and requested. The baby was aligned with good support in a football hold on the mothers right breast and a deep asymmetric latch was immediately obtained. The baby was eager and sustained consistent nutritive sucking. The pt was encouraged to perform breast compressions and to maintain close STS contact with the baby. The FOB and the maternal GM were attentive and supportive. The FOB inquired about supplementing with formula and questioned me if that was good for the baby. I provided education about the risk to the mothers milk supply and the beneficial nutrients that mothers milk supplies the baby with. I encouraged instead that the FOB perform STS also and observe for feeding cues and place the baby on the mothers breast at least 8 times in every 24 hour period. I educated them on cluster feedings and the implication that growth spurts require an increase in mothers milk production. I also educated the mother about engorgement and how to prevent it. The baby was maintained STS and was still nursing from the right breast when I left the room. F/U as needed and requested. [**NAME**] RN, CLC, BSN
