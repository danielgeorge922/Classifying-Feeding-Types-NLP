Lactation support and assistance: The pt had her baby resting across her abdomen with his mouth latched only on the nipple portion of a 24 mm nipple shield. I suggested that he be repositioned to improve both her comfort and to obtain a deeper latch. She requested that we try him without the nipple shield. The baby was placed STS on his abdomen tummy to chest with the pt. Her nipple was erect and the baby easily latched on with a deep asymmetric latch. I provided her with education regarding breast massage and hand expression. The pt had several lumps and knots in both breasts which I massaged with warm wash clothes and performed breast compressions while the baby displayed consistent and rhythmic sucking and swallowing. Milk was easily expressed from both breasts between nursing episodes. I encouraged frequent STS with the pt and the FOB. Feeding cues and feeding on demand at least 8-10 times/24hours was strongly reinforced. The [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] Breastfeeding book was provided and all successful lactation details were reviewed. I discussed the football nursing position and the pt verbalized satisfaction with using it. I explained the details of a nutritive latch, baby's daily feeding log, and important outpatient resources. I inquired about nipple pain or discomfort during or after breastfeeding. I provided her with a hospital grade electric pump and demonstrated it's use. The FOB assisted with the pumping process and participated in the cleaning and assembly of the pumping supplies. The pt had approximately 10 ml's of breast milk after about 10 minutes of pumping on the preemie cycle. I demonstrated the use of the hand pump and encouraged her to continue performing breast massage and compressions while nursing and to allow the bay to empty her breasts while nursing him on each side with each nursing session. I also recommended that she pump to completely empty her breasts if the baby is not able to in the beginning of his growth and development. I congratulated them both on the baby's birth and encouraged F/U with a lactation counselor for any further concerns with engorgement or breast feeding.  [**NAME**] RN, BSN, CLC
