MOB reported support from FOB ([**NAME**]) and MOB's mother and step-father. MOB stated that she and FOB live together with their (now) four children.   MOB reported that she started prenatal care late because she had trouble with Medicaid. She stated that she then went to all of her appointments, except when she was hospitalized for sickle cell crisis.   MOB reported all baby needs met, including car seat, clothing, diapers, wipes, and crib/bassinet. MOB reported that she receives WIC and Food Stamps, but declined referral for Healthy Start.  SW talked with MOB about her history with depression, anxiety, and panic attacks. She stated that most of her issues stem from sickle cell. She stated that the constant pain contributes to her depression. She also stated that she gets anxious about being alone with her children for long periods of time because she is afraid she will have a sickle cell crisis and not be able to get in touch with anyone for help. She stated that her most recent panic attack was when FOB left the home and accidentally took her phone with him. She stated that she started having pain and then could not call anyone for help. SW acknowledged these fears and concerns. SW encouraged MOB to seek counseling to help her manage these worries. MOB stated that her grandmother is her "counselor." SW encouraged this relationship, but also suggested that it is often good to have someone other than a family member as a counselor. MOB declined counseling with Healthy Start.   SW educated MOB about SIDS, Back to Sleep, and Shaken Baby Syndrome. SW also talked with MOB at length about her risk for post-partum depression and again encouraged her to seek help with a doctor or counselor if she notices signs or symptoms.   SW has no other concerns at this time.
