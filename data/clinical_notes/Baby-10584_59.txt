This note was copied from the chart of BABY/[**NAME**]. Lactation:  Follow-up consult for maternal nipple pain with feeds.  Although baby underwent frenotomy yesterday, baby has a high palate, which is a risk factor for nipple pain and nipple damage due to the nipple being moved higher with each suck, and mother's nipples are fairly short, which is another risk factor for nipple pain and nipple damage.  The shorter the maternal nipple, the greater the risk for the nipple to be in contact with the hard surfaces of the alveolar ridge and hard palate near the front of the baby's mouth, in contrast to the maternal comfort experienced when the nipple reaches the baby's soft palate, termed "the comfort zone" for the mother's comfort.  During yesterday evening's consult, mother's nipple was visibly creased/pinched in spite of baby's deep latch with wide gape well onto the areola.    This morning mother reports difficult feedings overnight with unsuccessful attempts by nursing staff when baby was crying near the breast, as compared to yesterday evening's lactation consultation when baby was brought to the breast in a calm state.  When babies are actively crying, the tongue is elevated with each cry, and the mother's nipple cannot then reach the superior aspect of the baby's tongue.  A helpful analogy is the impossible task of trying to drink out of a straw when placing the straw under the tongue, instead of correctly placing the straw above the tongue.  Today the mother reports she has decided to temporarily express her milk and give baby her bottled milk, due to painful feedings at the breast and baby's difficulty with the oral grasp at the breast.  Today baby's I & O sheet reflects adequate stooling and very high urine output, and the parents were given extensive teaching on monitoring baby's feedings and output by using the tracking sheet in [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**]'s breastfeeding handbook.    Mother was commended for her current volume of expressed milk, which is higher than average for baby's age (baby will reach 48 hours of age at 7:43pm today).  Mother was provided with a pumping log, and her two pumpings were recorded on this log in order for mother to assess her higher than average volume of expressed milk so soon after the birth.  Mother reports she expressed 8ml with the first of her daily pumpings today, and she expressed 15ml with second pumping this morning.  Today's goal for Day 3 postpartum is a daily total of 30 to 75ml from at least 8 pumpings, so mother's expressed milk thus far today at a total of 23ml from her two morning pumpings has impressively approached the low normal range of 30ml from at least 8 pumpings, and thus mother was highly commended for her milk production.    Evidence of Lactogenesis II in this mother is present re: the increase in volume over colostrum alone, and mother was advised to expect a full milk supply of 25 to 35 ounces daily by expressing her milk at least 8 times daily, including at least two nighttime pumpings, and this volume is typically achieved with such pumping frequency within 7 to 14 days after the birth.  Similarly, newborns need to feed at least 8 to 12 times every 24 hours in order to gain weight appropriately.   Parents report they will be taking baby for his first pediatrician's visit on Monday, [**DATE**].  We reviewed the contact information for infant nutrition resources listed in [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**]'s breastfeeding handbook, and mother was warmly invited, along with her baby, to [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**]' breastfeeding mothers support group on Tuesdays.  Mother was encouraged to call for assistance as needed/as desired, and to call with any questions or concerns.  [**NAME**], RN BSN IBCLC Lactation Consultant
