CT Head ([**DATE**]):  IMPRESSION: No evidence of metastatic disease on the exam. However, MR would be more sensitive   to detect small foci of metastatic disease.  CXR ([**DATE**]):  IMPRESSION: Slight hazy airspace disease in the left lung base which would be concerning for   left lower lobe pneumonia in the appropriate clinical circumstance. Minimal pulmonary edema is less likely given the asymmetrical distribution.  CXR ([**DATE**]):  IMPRESSION:   CARDIOMEGALY, SUSPICION FOR EDEMA AND WORSENING CONSOLIDATION OR POSSIBLY ATELECTASIS LEFT BASE.  TTE ([**DATE**]):  Conclusions  Normal left ventricular systolic function (EF 60-65). No regional wall  motion abnormalities identified.  No Doppler findings suggesting diastolic dysfunction or elevated LV  diastolic pressure.  Normal right ventricular size and systolic function.  No hemodynamically significant valvular dysfunction.  EKG ([**DATE**]): Sinus tachycardia     Hospital Course: 22 y.o. para2102 @ 23w2d with a twin gestation with one viable baby and one complete mole. She had been managed inpatient and treated medically for sequelae of her mole including hyperthyroid, with PTU, and hypertension. The day of delivery her blood pressures had acutely risen and her dose of labetalol had been increased from 400 BID to 600 TID. She called out that night with acute abdominal pain and bright red bleeding. She had a known clot near her cervix but this red blood and pain were concerning for new bleeding. She was transported to the OR where additional lines were placed, mag bolus was started, labs were sent and blood products were obtained. During this 30 minutes the fetal heart rate was minimally variable with a baseline in the 160s when it had previously been in the 140s, thus this was concerning for fetal compromise, possibly from abruption, thus we proceeded with delivery.    She was taken to the operating room on [**DATE**] and went on to deliver a Liveborn infant female weighing 570 grams with Apgars of 1, 2, 3 & 5. No cords gases due to cord sweeping. Hemosiderin stained amniotic fluid. Prior to intubation, baby required compressions but after ETT placed and surfactant given, baby responded well and left on 21% O2.   For the full operative information, see the operative note.    She received magnesium for 24 hours PP. Her blood pressures were controlled and on POD#5, her BP medications was discontinued     Her thyroid tests normalized and she was taken off PTU on POD#4.     Patient had a fever on POD#1 associated with shortness of breath and decreased O2 saturation. CXR showed mild pulmonary edema and atelectasis. She was given Lasix 10 mg IV x 1 with improvement of her symptoms and continued diuresis. Incentive spirometer was encouraged. She did not spike another fever.     On POD #6 Ms. Andreka McAffee desired discharge home.  She was ambulating without assistance, voiding on her own, tolerating a regular diet, and her pain was well controlled.  She was discharged home in good condition.    She will need to followup at [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] group in 1 week in HROB and then in 2 weeks with HRGYN. She will need to get weekly BHcg, which have already been ordered, for the next 1 year or until further notice. She received Depo Provera in the hospital and understands the importance of not getting pregnant in the next year while we are monitoring her Bhcg. She also understands that she will need a repeat cesarean section at 37 weeks for all future pregnancies.    Encouraged patient to maintain a healthy diet and participate in regular exercise to promote an overall healthy lifestyle.
