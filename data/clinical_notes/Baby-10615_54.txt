This note was copied from the chart of BOY/[**NAME**]. Lactation:  Discharge rounds in follow-up of yesterday's consults.  Upon my arrival, baby was nursing in the cradle hold on the right breast.  The baby's feeding position was ideally aligned, and baby displayed appropriate jaw excursions and appropriately rhythmic suckling.    Mother pointed out the small bottle of transitional milk on her bedside table, stating that she began pumping last night to spoon-feed baby prior to the baby being able to latch during a fussy period, when the dyad received assistance from the night nurse for baby's latch.  The most recent pumping is reported by the mother as an impressive 30ml volume.  Mother reports that baby "fed off and on all night - - for six hours", and we discussed the commonly reported "second night phenomenon" re: formerly sleepy newborns now waking with a period of much more frequent feeding.    Mother states that they have been recording baby's feeds and diaper changes in the log in [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**]'s breastfeeding handbook that was provided to her yesterday, and mother acknowledged receiving the invitation yesterday to [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**]' outpatient breastfeeding mothers' support group as well.
