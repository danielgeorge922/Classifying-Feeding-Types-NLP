This note was copied from the chart of GIRL/[**NAME**]. Lactation:  Rounds with MOB for bilateral nipple damage by RN Thetoria's report.  Discussed with the mother that her shorter nipple anatomy is vulnerable to nipple damage, though not a guarantee of nipple damage, due to the shorter nipple coming into greater contact with the baby's alveolar ridge and hard palate, as these hard surfaces are often  damaging to the maternal nipple.  Mother has been provided a USP-lanolin product by her RN, and we discussed the recommendation to pump for 2 to 5 minutes prior to helping baby with latch, so that the nipple has further depth into the tip of the nipple shield for the feeding, with less likelihood of the nipple staying in contact with the alveolar ridge and/or hard palate throughout feedings.   Mother was assisted in positioning her baby in the football hold on the L.  The nipple shield was partially inverted prior to application in order to protract the nipple, and this was effective in protracting the nipple, albeit not with maximum protractility.   Mother was advised to pump for 2 to 5 minutes prior to nursing baby with or without the shield.    For the nursing staff:  Please assess the mother's nipples for any further nipple damage and the healing process, and please assist the dyad with positioning and the baby's oral grasp as needed for effective milk transfer.
