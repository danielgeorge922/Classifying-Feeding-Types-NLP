Lactation:  Consult per mother's request for nipple soreness with initial latch only.   Lactation history:  Mother reports she nursed her two sons for 14 months and 1 year respectively.    Feeding assessment:  I observed baby in mid-feed through the end of the feed in the cradle hold on the right, and baby had an optimal deep latch with wide gape well onto the areola.  When baby finished the feed, the right nipple was nonreddened and intact, although there is an arc along the underside of the nipple from 8 o'clock to 4 o'clock that appears to be a very slight inversion of that portion of the nipple.  The L nipple is also nonreddened and intact, and is also partially inverted but more so than the right, with a similar but deeper arc at the inverted aspect of the L nipple.  Breasts are medium in size, closely spaced, rounded and symmetrical.    Mother had previously been provided with a USP-grade lanolin product for nipple care, and mother was encouraged to apply the lanolin to any sore area of her nipples after each feed.  Mother was advised that one aspect of her nipple soreness may be the pull of the inverted aspects of her nipples while the baby suckles, and another aspect is the discomfort with the initial latch when the mother's nipple is pulled past the hard surfaces of baby's alveolar ridge and hard palate.  This latter aspect of nipple soreness should be fleeting within the first few seconds of the latch, due to the nipple then being pulled to the baby's soft palate with continued suckling.    An additional observable aspect of the mother's transient soreness during the feed occurred when the mother pressed her breast tissue away from baby's nose, citing the need to create more breathing space for baby's nose.  Mother was advised that pulling the breast tissue away from baby's nose was unnecessary due to baby's adequate breathing space, which was pointed out during the feed, and mother was advised that pulling the breast tissue away from baby has the undesired effect of pulling the nipple back toward the front of baby's mouth near the hard surfaces of the baby's alveolar ridge and hard palate, which can be damaging to the maternal nipple.    Mother stated that she does not plan to work outside the home anytime soon.  Mother was advised of the Affordable Care Act's mandate to private health insurance companies to provide insured mothers with a breastpump per birth.  Mother was provided with [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**]'s breastfeeding handbook with a brief review of the two-page feeding & diaper count chart.  Mother was provided with an invitation to [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**]' Breastfeeding Mothers' Support Group on Tuesdays. Mother was encouraged to call for assistance as desired, and to call with any questions or concerns.  [**NAME**], RN BSN IBCLC Lactation Consultant
