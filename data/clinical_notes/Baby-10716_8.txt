R3 Ultrasound:  Singleton fetus  Cephalic presentation  Posterior placenta, no previa EFW: 4362g (>90%) AFI: 16.8 cm  BPP [**DATE**]  Discussed estimated fetal weight with patient in the setting of a nulliparous patient, with unfavorable cervix, with uncontrolled diabetes at 37 weeks. Given all this information, would recommend undergo a primary cesarean section for delivery. Specifically, discussed risk of fetal macrosomia and subsequent shoulder dystocia including but not limited to fetal clavicle/humerus, brachial plexus injury, and fetal hypoxia as well as significant maternal laceration with subsequent fecal and urine incontinence. At this time, patient agrees to a primary cesarean section for delivery.   Patient's blood pressures are now elevated in the mild range (140-150s/100s), which is a change from clinic. She has trace urine protein. She is asymptomatic and physical exam is significant for bilateral symmetric lower extremity edema. Will perform PreE panel and Pr:Cr ratio and CTM blood pressures closely. In light of newly elevated BPs at 37 weeks with concurrent uncontrolled GDM, will likely deliver patient once blood glucose is well controlled (~100-110).    [**NAME**], MD
