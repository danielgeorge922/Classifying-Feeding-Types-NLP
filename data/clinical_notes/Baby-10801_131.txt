Spoke to patient who is upset that she has been here so long and strongly desires discharge. She reiterated that she has no symptoms at all and feels her bp is where it usually is at home, has had chronic hypertension. Her care had been discussed with Dr. [**NAME**] this morning as she desired discharge. Given that her labs were improving, asymptomatic and reliable for follow-up we felt comfortable with discharge and outpatient follow-up in HROB this week with repeat labs; however wanted a few repeat bp given last at 0900 at 140s/100s. She has now had two 150s/90s, mild range but more elevated than yesterday. She feels this is mostly due to her agitation. She has a bp cuff at home and can reliably check herself, has her prescription and instructions for procardia 60 mg daily in am and sees no barriers to obtaining this medication, and is willing to have repeat labs and f/u this week. She was given strict pre-e precautions and emphasized importance of follow-up. She will have labs done at 0800 Thursday morning and be seen in HROB clinic at 0900 (msg sent to schedulers), patient advised where to go. All questions answered and patient comfortable with plan of care. D/c orders placed.  [**NAME**], MD
