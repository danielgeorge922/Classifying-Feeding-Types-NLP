This note was copied from the chart of BOY/[**NAME**]. Lactation:  Rounds with mother [**NAME**], a 28 y/o G5P3023 who gave birth vaginally at home on [**DATE**] at 10:30pm to baby boy Fletcher.  Birth weight: 2255g (4lb 15.5oz).  Gestational age by dates: 36w4d.  GA by exam: AGA.  Per chart, mother's obstetric care was terminated at her practice due to missed appointments and missed lab work; when mother called to come in to be checked, she was advised not to come in.  Two accounts of the baby's birth are in chart: 1) the baby was born at home in bed, or 2) the baby was born at home, falling 12 inches to the floor.  Baby is receiving supplemental feeds of bottled formula re: glucose protocol, though mother reports baby "throws up" the formula, then has had some difficulty with latching.  Mother states that although her baby is awakening, her nurse has advised not to feed the baby until the next blood sugar test.    Lactation history:  Mother reports she nursed her last child for two months, "but then I just dried up."  Mother reports giving formula to her baby after many breastfeeds prior to the weaning, "becauses I didn't have enough milk - - he was always hungry."    Patient teaching:  Mother was asked if she would like a breastpump to express her milk for any supplemental feeds, and the mother stated, "Yes."  A medical-grade electric breastpump was brought to the mother's room, and a demonstration was provided to the mother in regard to assembly, dissembly, and washing of pump parts.  Mother also stated that she was familiar with this breastpump due to having pumped previously for a baby in NICU.  A pumping log was provided to the mother with a review of volume expectations re: drops or no drops today.  Mother was encouraged to pump at least 8 to 10 times daily in order to provide adequate breast stimulation for any missed feeding at the breast.  Mother was given [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**]'s breastfeeding handbook, and we reviewed common ages for baby's upcoming growth spurts.  We discussed the temporary nature of breast engorgement, and this content was also shown to mother from the breastfeeding handbook.  Mother was encouraged to call for assistance as desired, and to call with any questions or concerns.    [**NAME**], RN BSN IBCLC Lactation Consultant
