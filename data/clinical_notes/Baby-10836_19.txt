MOB immediately downstairs to smoke, asking for a "babysitter". Informed mother that we do not have a nursery and that someone with a baby band will have to stay with infant. FOB at bedside asking if he can keep crib at bedside so he doesn't have to hold baby. Also, asking for bottle to feed baby because MOB will be having grandmother babysit and she cant "whip out her old titty" to feed him. FOB informed that mother needs to receive education before a bottle will be provided.
