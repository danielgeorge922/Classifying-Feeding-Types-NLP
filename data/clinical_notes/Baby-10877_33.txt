Lactation support and assistance: I saw this pt today while she was breast feeding her infant daughter. The baby was held in a cradle position and was displaying great STS bonding and a deep nutritive latch as she continuously sucked and swallowed while we talked. I encouraged the use of pillows to supply support and comfort and prevent muscle strain. I provided her with the [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] breastfeeding booklet and reviewed the information as well as resource numbers in the back for continued lactation support after D/C home. Educated about breast massage and hand expression with focus on the benefits and encouraged to perform frequently to prevent engorgement and plugged ducts. Encouraged frequent STS. Feeding cues and feeding on demand at least 8-10 times/24hours reinforced. Discussed alternate nursing positions, details of a nutritive latch, baby's daily feeding log, and outpatient resources.  Questioned pt regarding pain or discomfort during or after breastfeeding. She denies any pain or concerns at this time.Congratulated on baby's birth and encouraged patient to call for any questions or concerns.  [**NAME**] BSN, CLC
