This note was copied from the chart of GIRL/[**NAME**]. Lactation:  Consult by mother's request on day of discharge home.  Mother has severe nipple and areolar damage on the right, and mother reports this began in the operating room when baby latched onto the breast.  Mother is a registered nurse who works in a correctional facility for mentally ill prisoners, and states she has been provided with a high-end retail breastpump by her health insurance company.  Mother reports bringing this breastpump and using it during this hospital stay, but reports pain when pumping, particularly on the right.    Mother has a history of bilateral breast augmentation.    Yesterday lactation nurse [**NAME**] reported that she had changed mother's breast shield on the mother's retail breastpump from a 24mm to a 27mm shield, due to the mother's nipple and areolar damage.    Lactation history:  Mother reports she expressed her milk and exclusively bottle-fed her 5 y/o child for 6 months, following the difficulty of unsuccessful breastfeeding attempts.   Maternal breast assessment:  Breasts are medium to large (with augmentation) on this small mother's frame, rounded, closely spaced and symmetrical.  Nipple anatomy is very large in diameter bilaterally, and the L nipple is partially inverted though protracted at the base, as well as nonreddened and intact.  Nipple anatomy on the right is protracted but short, and reddened with an arc'd bruise at the most distal aspect of the nipple from 12 o'clock to 5 o'clock.   The L areola is nonreddened and intact, although the right areola is severely reddened, more so along the superior aspect of the right areola.  There is a partial thickness Stage III areolar wound at 11 o'clock proximal to the nipple, 1 mm x  2mm in diameter.    Feeding assessment:  Mother was assisted in positioning her baby in cross-cradle and cradle holds on the L side, and baby was unable to latch without the support of a 24mm nipple shield.  With the 24mm nipple shield, baby latched with minimal guidance, then nursed in an appropriately rhythmic manner with appropriate jaw excursions for approximately 10 minutes.  Baby slept briefly, then was assisted in the football hold on the right.  Remarkably, given the extent of the mother's nipple damage, she was able to comfortably tolerate the feeding on the right by using the 24mm nipple shield.    Interventions and patient teaching:  Mother was provided with a medical-grade electric breastpump to give her the superior experience of the medical-grade EBP for her comfort, and mother reported a painless pumping experience using custom 36mm breast shields, versus the 27mm breast shields that she reports receiving yesterday.  Mother was given information on medical-grade electric breastpump rentals as needed.  A USP-grade lanolin product was provided to the mother, and she applied this to the wounded right nipple and areola.  Mother inquired about using the breast shells provided to her yesterday, reporting that she is using one breast shell on the right for her nipple wounds, and is using the breast shell on the L to further protract the partial inversion of that nipple.  As the breast shell attachment for inverted nipples is significantly smaller than the mother's nipple diameter, mother was advised that she may wear the breast shell on the L with the soreness attachment as needed, although that nipple has no visible injuries at present.     We discussed recent (2015) and past studies correlating early nipple shield use with poor infant weight gain and shorter duration of breastfeeding.  We discussed one study that showed an increased transfer of milk from the breast by preterm infants using a nipple shield, in which the mothers of the preterm infants had been previously pumping to build their milk supplies prior to the preterm infants going to the breast.  We discussed another study on nipple shield use in which no correlation was found re: poor infant weight gain or shorter duration of breastfeeding.  I shared my own professional experiences in lactation of seeing more babies with slow/poor weight gain when a mother has not been pumping at all from birth during early nipple shield use, as well as seeing fewer babies who are using a nipple shield with appropriate weight gain whose mothers have never pumped since birth.     Due to the published risks of early nipple shield use, mother was advised to pump after nursing at least 6 times daily until baby shows a pattern of consistent weight gain, then to gradually reduce her pumpings by dropping one pumping every 2 to 3 days, while giving baby unrestricted access to the breast and monitoring baby's I & O re: counting number of daily feeds for at least 8 to 12 feeds daily, and following the feeding diary with the listed expected daily output from [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**]'s breastfeeding handbook.  Mother's RN background was emphasized re: monitoring baby's I & O.   We reviewed the contact information on regional infant nutrition resources from [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**]'s breastfeeding handbook, including lactation consultants [**NAME**] with [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**]'s Center for Breastfeeding and Newborns, and [**NAME**], who is in private practice.  Mother was encouraged to call for assistance as needed, and to call with any questions or concerns.    [**NAME**], RN BSN IBCLC Lactation Consultant
