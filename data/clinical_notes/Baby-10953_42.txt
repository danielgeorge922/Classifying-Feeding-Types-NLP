This note was copied from the chart of BOY/Gala Olaciregui. Lactation:  Lengthy feeding assistance by RN request for difficult latch.  Babe is s/p frenotomy.  Feeding challenges during this consult were thus: 1) the mother has very large, heavy and pendulous breasts, 2) the mother's nipple anatomy is larger than average in diameter, short, and with minimal protractility, 3) baby has a recessed chin, and 4) baby is s/p frenotomy with poor suck organization that has improved slightly with much clinical support.  Mother stated early in the consult that she wants very much to breastfeed her baby, emphasizing that she is "willing to do whatever it takes."  Mother is employed by [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] as a coder.    Feeding assessment:   Suck training was provided to baby following initial difficulty with latch, and baby's suck showed slow but gradual improvement in organization at the breast via much clinical support re: breast compression toward baby's mouth to stimulate the suck reflex.   Mother was assisted in using a medical-grade electric breastpump to stimulate/further protract her nipples, and this was effective for several minutes in further protracting the nipple tissue, though the nipples soon returned to a shorter length.  Mother was assisted in positioning her baby in football hold and cradle holds, and a rolled up sheet was placed under the breasts to provide enough lift of the nipple toward the baby versus the natural downward slant of the nipple due to very large and pendulous breasts.  Baby was assisted with latch with and without the nipple shield, and baby's lengthiest success was with the 24mm nipple shield, although baby did display less than 5 minutes of suckling behavior on the L breast without the nipple shield, following several minutes of pumping to protract the nipple tissue.  Baby cluster-fed back and forth between the breasts many times, and either saliva or a very small amount of clear colostrum was noted in the tip of the nipple shield over the course of a lengthy consult.  The mother did not release any drops of colostrum during the pumping session, although the L nipple became well-protracted with pumping, but only briefly.  As the cluster-feed progressed when baby was able to latch without the nipple shield, the mother's L nipple had a horizontally creased compression mark after baby nursed for several minutes in the football hold.  The lengthy breastfeeding practice session ended via tube-feeding formula at the breast with tubing inserted into the corner of baby's mouth.  Even with tube-feeding at the breast, suckling was not yet highly organized.    Patient teaching:  Mother was instructed in the use of the medical-grade electric breastpump in order to help her nipples to become more protractile to help baby with latch, and in order to provide her breasts with adequate stimulation due to early nipple shield use.  We discussed several studies, including a 2015 study, that have correlated early nipple shield use with poor infant weight gain and shorter duration of breastfeeding.  We discussed one study that did not find any correlation with early nipple shield use and shorter duration of breastfeeding, as well as another important study that found preterm infants could transfer greater volumes of milk from the breast using a nipple shield, and lesser volumes of milk from the breast without the support of a nipple shield, although the mothers of these preterm infants had been expressing their milk for their preterm infants for some time prior to breastfeeding practice.  Due to the above studies, mother was advised to pump for 15 minutes after any feed in which baby requires the nipple shield for the time being, and mother was given the option to pump prior to feeding in order to protract her nipples, whether or not baby needs the support of the nipple shield to latch and suckle.    For Pediatrics:  Even though mother is recovering from a vaginal birth, an additional day of inpatient infant feeding support will likely be of great benefit to both mother and baby.
