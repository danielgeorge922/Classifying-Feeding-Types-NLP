Discussed with the patient the option of a primary cesarean section secondary to fetus large for gestational age (EFW 4203 g) and history of urethral and clitoral lacerations with her last delivery of a 7 lb 6 oz infant. We discussed that with a LGA baby there is increased risk of shoulder dystocia which may cause fetal neurologic injury, fetal hypoxia, or severe maternal lacerations which may cause future incontinence. The risks/benefits of vaginal vs cesarean delivery were reviewed with the patient. After discussion with her husband, the patient opts for primary cesarean section.   The patient was consented for cesarean section and any other indicated procedures and blood products. Specifically, she was counseled on risks, benefits, indications and alternatives to the above and other indicated procedures, including bleeding, infection, damage to adjacent organs, reaction to anesthesia, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and death. She was also counseled on risks, benefits, indications and alternatives to blood transfusion, including infection (HIV, hepatitis, CMV, unknown), transfusion reaction, allergic reaction, metabolic complications, cardiac arrhythmia, and death. Patient understands the risks, accepts the risks including but not limited to those above, and consents to the procedures. Consents signed, witnessed, and placed into the chart.  Anesthesia notified, antibiotics ordered.   [**NAME**] M.D.
