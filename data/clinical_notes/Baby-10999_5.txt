Fascia adherent to underlying muscle. No significant intraperitoneal adhesions. Some filmy adhesions present on left upper portion of uterus. Liveborn infant male weighing 3662 grams with Apgars of 9 and 9.  SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY: bilateral portions of fallopian tubes  INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 29 y.o. female para 1102 at 38w4d with history of prior cesarean x 2 presented from clinic for delivery via repeat cesarean due to concerning BPP [**DATE**] which was done when she reported decreased fetal movement. On arrival here she had reactive and reassuring NST.  DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfannenstiel incision. The incision was taken down to the level of the fascia which was incised in the midline. The incision was extended laterally in either direction over the rectus muscles. The fascia was dissected off the rectus muscle superiorly and then inferiorly. The rectus muscle was divided bluntly. The peritoneum was entered in a clear space sharply.  A bladder flap was attempted but due to very thin lower uterine segment could not be easily separated.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with the surgeon's fingers.  The amniotic fluid was clear.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood was obtained for analysis.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.  The uterus was exteriorized, and the uterine incision was closed in 1 layer, a running, locking suture incorporating the serosa. Two additional figure-of-eight sutures were placed in the midline of the hysterotomy for further hemostasis.    The right fallopian tube was identified by the fimbria, double ligated with 0-chromic suture and the intervening segment excised.  The left fallopian tube was identified by the fimbria, double ligated with 0-chromic suture and the intervening segment excised.    The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity.  Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision, posterior to the bladder, and in the subfascial area.  The fascial closure was started at one end and run to the midline. Just after started fascial closure from the opposite end there was a slight welling up of dilute appearing blood that was persistent and concerning for underlying active bleeding.  Therefore, the fascial sutures were removed and the entire abdomen was re-explored for hemostasis. A few small areas of oozing were noted in the torn muscle edges and small vessels underneath the fascia superiorly which were cauterized with the Bovie. The pericolic gutters were cleaned out, the uterine incision was re-examined, site of tubal ligation re-examined and no source of active bleeding identified after irrigation. The fascia was then closed again using 2 sutures running from either end of the incision and meeting in the midportion. There was no continued welling up of blood and it was presumed what was seen earlier was due to run down and possible slight oozing from the muscle edges which were cauterized.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and re-approximated with interrupted sutures of 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with a running subcuticular closure of 3-0 monocryl. Dermabond was applied to the incision.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.
