Date of Surgery: [**DATE**]  PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  1) Intrauterine pregnancy at 37 weeks 2 days 2) Type 1 DM on insulin pump 3) Arrest of dilation  POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  1) Intrauterine pregnancy at 37 weeks 2 days 2) Type 1 DM on insulin pump 3) Arrest of dilation 4) Delivered  PROCEDURE:  1) Low transverse cesarean section  SURGEON: [**NAME**] ASSISTANT: [**NAME**]  ANESTHESIOLOGIST: [**NAME**] ANESTHESIA ASSISTANT: Chanowski  ANESTHESIA: Epidural  EBL: 800 mL  FLUID REPLACEMENT: 1500 mL  FINDINGS: Normal uterus, tubes and ovaries bilaterally.  Liveborn infant male weighing 3420 grams with Apgars of 1 and 5.  SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY: Placenta  INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 25 y.o. female para 0010 who presented for induction of labor for poorly controlled type 1 diabetes on an insulin pump. During induction of labor the patient developed an arrest of dilation at 4 cm. The decision was made to proceed with cesarean delivery.   DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfanenstiel incision. The subcutaneous tissue was incised with electrocautery. The fascia was scored with electrocautery. The fascia was dissected from the anterior rectus muscle using electrocautery, curved mayo scissors, and blunt dissection. The rectus muscle was divided at the midline. The peritoneum was entered using Metzenbaum scissor. The peritoneal incision was extended bilaterally with traction.  A bladder flap was not created.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with traction.  The amniotic fluid was clear.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood were obtained for analysis.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.  The uterus was exteriorized, and the uterine incision was closed in two layers, the first a running suture of 0 Vicryl and the second a running, imbricating suture of 0 Vicryl.    The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity.  Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision and in the subfascial area.  The fascia was closed with two running sutures of 0-Vicryl starting from each angle and meeting at the midline.  The subcutaneous tissue was closed with a running suture of 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with a running subcuticular closure of 3-0 Monocryl.  Dermabond was applied to the incision.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.  Complications:  None  [**NAME**] M.D.
