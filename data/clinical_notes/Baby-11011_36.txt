Chief Note  To bedside to discuss plan of care with patient.  We reviewed the events of the day and her intermittent deep variable decelerations.  Her pitocin is currently at 0.5.  We reviewed her current tracing, which is an overall reassuring category 2.  We then discussed her options a this time, including a) increasing her pitocin, b) attempting another IUPC placement with amnioinfusion and increasing her pitocin, or c) cesarean delivery.  We discussed the risks and benefits of each.  We decided to examine her cervix in order to make a decision.  SVE: 5/70/-2/Soft;Mid-Position, cord prolapsing through internal os- Kinson ([**DATE**] 1947) FHT: 130, Variability: Moderate, Accelerations;Early decelerations;Variable decelerations, Intermittent variable decelerations with shouldering - overall reassuring category 2 TOCO: irreg, Mode: Toco   A: 29 y.o. P0 at 41w0d with cord prolapse at 5 cm with reassuring cat 2 FHT.  P: Discussed exam findings with the patient and her family, and expressed the need for immediate cesarean delivery.  Due to reassuring FHT at this time, I recommended that we proceed in a controlled manner with regional anesthesia (pt has epidural in place).  Dr. [**NAME**] was instructed to hold the fetal head out of the pelvis to reduce the risk of cord compression.  Dr. [**NAME**] and Anesthesiology were notified.  Plan to proceed for emergent cesarean delivery.  [**NAME**] MD MA
