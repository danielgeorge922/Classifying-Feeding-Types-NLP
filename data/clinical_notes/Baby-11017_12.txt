OB Cesarean Section Operative Note  Date of Surgery: [**DATE**]  Preoperative Diagnosis:  1.  IUP @ 41w4d gestation 2.  Prior c/s x1 3.  Suspected macrosomia 4.  Rh negative  Postoperative Diagnosis: Same, delivered  Operation Performed: Repeat Low Transverse Cesarean Section  Surgeon: [**NAME**]  Assisstant: [**NAME**]  Anesthesiologist: [**NAME**]  Anesthesiology Assisstant: Al-[**NAME**]  Anesthesia: Spinal  Pathology: None  EBL: 700 mL  UOP:  50 mL  Fluids:  1200 cc crystalloid  Findings: Anterior placenta.  Normal uterus.  Tubes and ovaries not inspected due to significant intraperitoneal adhesions preventing access to the adnexa bilaterally.  Significant adhesions between the anterior uterus in the upper segment and the anterior abdominal wall.  Liveborn infant male weighing 3742 grams with Apgars of 9 and 9.  Indication: [**NAME**] is a 19 y.o. female para 1031 who presented to L&D triage at 41w3d gestation with decreased FM.  Noted to have reactive NST.  H/O limited prenatal care due to multiple moves during pregnancy, no care since 30 weeks.  Due to late term gestation, complaints of decreased FM, h/o prior c/s x1, and suspected macrosomia (measured 4300g on growth sono in triage) - plans were made for repeat cesarean delivery.  Pt declined BTI and plans depo postpartum.  Procedure: After satisfactory anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped in a routine fashion for abdominal surgery.  Time-out confirmed patient and procedure.  The abdomen was entered with a Pfannenstiel approach and dissected down to the level of the fascia with sharp dissection and cautery. The fascia was scored in the midline and extended laterally with sharp dissection. The anterior leaf of the fascia was grasped upwards and the underlying rectus muscle was dissected with sharp and blunt dissection. This was also performed inferiorly. The rectus muscles were separated in the midline and the peritoneum was entered and the underlying uterus exposed.  On entry into the peritoneal, significant adhesions were noted between the anterior uterus in the upper segment and the anterior abdominal wall.  A small tear in the uterine serosa was made while examining adhesions, which was later repaired.  Fetal position was confirmed.  The lower uterine segement identified and found to be clear of adhesions.  A bladder flap was created.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and extended laterally with blunt dissection.  Amniotic fluid was clear at the time of rupture.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation and gave a spontaneous cry.  The cord was clamped and cut and the baby handed to the pediatrician.  Blood for gases and DNA was obtained then cord blood donation was performed.  The placenta was delivered with cord traction.  The uterus was not able to be exteriorized due to significant adhesions, but was instead left in place and wiped out with a lap.  The uterus was closed in a single running locked layer closure using 0-Monocryl. The area of torn serosa identified during peritoneal entry was repaired with a running stitch of 2-0 Vicryl and found to be hemostatic. The uterine incision was carefully inspected, found to be hemostatic, and uterine tone was adequate. The fascia was inspected superiorly and inferiorly and was found to be intact and hemostatic.  The fascia was closed with 1 suture of 0-Vicryl starting at the angle and running in a continuous fashion to the opposite angle. The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and closed with 4 interrupted sutures of 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with a running subcuticular stitch of 4-0 Monocryl.  Dermabond was applied.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  There were no identified complications.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.   [**NAME**]
