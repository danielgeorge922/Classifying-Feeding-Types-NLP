Liveborn infant female weighing 500 grams with Apgars of 1, 6, and 6.   SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY: Placenta  INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 26 y.o. female P1011 who was transferred from an outside facility for worsening fetal status in the setting of possible heart defect, suspected severe uteroplacental insufficiency with fetal IUGR and oligohydramnios and maternal uncontrolled CHTN and Type 1 DM with renal failure. Upon arrival, fetus was noted to have a Cat 3 FHT and 2/10 biophysical profile score. After extensive counseling with MFM and Neonatology, the patient desired delivery with full neonatal resuscitation if needed. As such, she was taken to the OR for a cesarean section given fetal malpresentation and prior C/S x 1.   DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfannenstiel incision. The incision was taken down to the level of the fascia which was incised in the midline. The incision was extended laterally in either direction over the rectus muscles. The fascia was dissected off the rectus muscle superiorly and then inferiorly. The rectus muscle was divided bluntly. The peritoneum was entered in a clear space sharply.  A bladder flap was not created.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with the surgeon's fingers.  The amniotic fluid was scant but clear.  The above described infant was delivered from the Breech presentation, with immediate delivery of the flexed aftercoming head after the body.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood was obtained for analysis.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.  The uterus was exteriorized, and the uterine incision was closed in 2 layers, the first a running suture of 0-Vicryl and the second a running, imbricating suture of 0-Vicryl. Several figure of eight sutures of 2-0 Vicryl were placed at the site of the hysterotomy for additional hemostasis.    The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity.  Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision, posterior to the bladder, and in the subfascial area.  The fascia was closed with one suture of 0 Vicryl beginning from one end of the incision and running towards the other.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated. The skin was closed with a running subcuticular closure of 3-0 Monocryl.  Dermabond was applied to the incision.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.  [**NAME**], MD  Attending Note: I was present for the entire procedure.
