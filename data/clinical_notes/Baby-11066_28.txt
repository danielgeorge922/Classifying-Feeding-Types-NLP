OB Cesarean Section Operative Note  Date of Surgery: [**DATE**]  Preoperative Diagnosis:  1) IUP at 39w3d 2) Failure to Dilate   Postoperative Diagnosis:  1) IUP at 39w3d-delivered  2) Failure to Dilate   Operation Performed: Primary Low Transverse Cesarean Section  Surgeon: Dr. [**NAME**]   Assisstant: Dr. [**NAME**], Dr. [**NAME**]   Anesthesiologist: [**NAME**]  Anesthesiology Assisstant: Chanowski  Anesthesia: Epidural   Pathology: None  EBL: 800 mL  UOP:  125 mL  Fluids:  1500 cc  Findings: Normal uterus, tubes and ovaries bilaterally.  Liveborn infant male weighing 3744 grams with Apgars of 9 and 9.  Indication: [**NAME**] is a 19 y.o. female para 0 who dilated to 6 cm, with failure to progress. She was started on pitocin and increased appropriately. At 0015 she was unchanged despite appropriate rate and an IUPC was placed. Despite adequate MVUs, she is still 6 cm dilated, completely effaced, and +1 station. Decision was made to proceed with primary cesarean delivery.  Procedure: After satisfactory anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped in a routine fashion for abdominal surgery.  Time-out confirmed patient and procedure.  The abdomen was entered with a low pfannenstiel approach and dissected down to the level of the fascia with sharp dissection and cautery. The fascia was scored in the midline and extended laterally with sharp dissection. The anterior leaf of the fascia was grasped upwards and the underlying rectus muscle was dissected with sharp and blunt dissection. This was also performed inferiorly. The rectus muscles were separated in the midline and the peritoneum was entered and the underlying uterus exposed.  A bladder flap was created.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and extended laterally with blunt dissection.  Amniotic fluid was clear.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation and gave a spontaneous cry.  The cord was clamped and cut and the baby handed to the pediatrician.  Blood for gases and DNA was obtained. Cord blood donation was completed. The placenta was delivered with cord traction.  The uterus was exteriorized and wiped out with a lap.  The uterus was closed in a double layer closure using 0-Monocryl. The initial layer was a running locked layer and the second layer was an imbricating layer.The uterus was placed back into the peritoneal cavity. The uterine incision was hemostatic and uterine tone adequate. The gutters were wiped out with a moist lap.The fascia was inspected superiorly and inferiorly and was found to be intact and hemostatic.  The fascia was closed with 2 suture/s of 0-Vicryl starting at the angle and running in a continuous fashion. The subcutaneous tissue was closed with a running 3-0 Monocryl. The skin was closed with 4-0 monocryl.  Dermabond was applied.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.
