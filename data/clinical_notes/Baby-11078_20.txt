The pt was sitting up in the rocking chair and the baby was crying and flailing at her breast. I offered assistance and while trying to calm the baby by using my gloved finger to apply oral stimulation the baby began biting down hard on it. The pt verbalized that the baby has been biting on her breast as well. I observed a posterior frenulum that prevents the baby from extending her tongue to her gum line. The mother continued to try to latch the baby. I helped her express 5 ml's of BM from her left breast and spoon fed the baby without difficulty. She settled and returned to sleep STS on the mothers chest. I notified [**NAME**] in the NBN about the need for the Pediatricians assessment and possible frenotomy. I talked to the mother about the use of a nipple shield in the meantime but she was distracted by the baby's movements and trying to support her while sitting up. Continue to offer support and assistance with baby s latch and positioning. [**NAME**] BSN, CLC
