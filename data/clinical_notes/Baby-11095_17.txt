Lactation note:  Went to NICU 3 to see mother and infant.  Mother experienced breastfeeder and currently still breastfeeding 18 month old child. Mother had newborn to breast in cross cradle hold on left when i walked over and denied problems breastfeeding.   Breasts, soft  Nipples, everted, wide base, intact  Encouraged feeding on demand based upon cues without restriction on duration.  Additionally, encouraged breast stimulation either by newborn or pumping at least 8 times in 24 hours to ensure full milk supply. Also encouraged feeding newborn first before her 18 month old and watching/counting wet and dirty diapers on newborn to ensure adequate intake.  Currently newborn is on IV fluids in the NICU so it is less of an issue.  Encouraged mom to call lactation with any problems. Verbalized understanding.
