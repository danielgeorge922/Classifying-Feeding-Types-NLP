Dr. [**NAME**],ENT team and Dr. [**NAME**],NICU team were present at delivery  Procedure: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room. After satisfactory anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped in a routine fashion for abdominal surgery.  Time-out confirmed patient and procedure.  It was confirmed that she had received her prophylactic antibiotics and that her sequential compression stockings were in place and functioning. The abdomen was entered with a Pfannensteil approach.  The subcutaneous tissue was dissected up to the fascia. The fascia was incised in the midline and  extended bilaterally by the mayo scissors. The rectus muscles were separated from the overlying rectus sheath superiorly and inferiorly. The rectus was then separated in the midline and peritoneum entered carefully. A self retaining retractor was placed. A bladder flap was not created and then an approximately 4cm transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel. The amniotic membrane was separated from the uterine muscle circumferentially, being careful not to disrupt the membrane prematurely.The retainer portion of the hysterotomy stapler (Premium poly CS-Covidien) was introduced initially on the left all the time lifting the tips of the retainer up against the uterine muscle to avoid inadvertently injuring any fetal tissues. The hysterotomy stappler was fired once it was clear the retainer was clear of uterine vessels and fetal tissue. The stappler was then replaced and reloaded with the same procedure performed on maternal right of the hysterotomy. The fetal head was delivered through the hysterotomy into the intact amniotic sac. Once the fetal head was delivered through the hysterotomy, the amniotic sac was ruptured, fluid was clear.  The infant was delivered cephalic up to the level of both arms and Dr [**NAME**] with his ENT team intubated the infant uneventfully. Upon completion, the umbilical cord was clamped and cut,blood for gases and DNA obtained  with baby handed to the waiting pediatricians. .  The placenta was delivered with cord traction.  The uterus was wiped out with a lap.  The uterus was closed in a double layer closure using two layers of 0- vicryl.  The fascia was closed with 1 suture/s of 0-Vicryl starting at the angle and running in a continuous fashion. The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and reapproximated with interrupted sutures of 2-0 chromic.  The skin was closed with 4-0 monocryl.  Dermabond was applied.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.  [**NAME**] MD  I was present for the entire case.  I reviewed the resident's note and made appropriate corrections and additions to it.
