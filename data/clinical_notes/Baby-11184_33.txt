Department of OB/GYN Operative Report  Date of Surgery: [**DATE**]  Preoperative Diagnosis: (1) Undesired Fertility   (2) Postpartum   (3) Multiparity  Postoperative Diagnosis: (1) Undesired Fertility   (2) Postpartum   (3) Multiparity  Operation Performed: Bilateral Modified Pomeroy Tubal Interruption  Surgeon: [**NAME**]  Assistant: [**NAME**]  Anesthesiologist: [**NAME**]  Resident: [**NAME**]  Anesthesia: Spinal  Pathology: Segment of each tube  EBL: 5ml  UOP:  300cc  Fluids:  500cc crystalloid  Findings: Normal Uterus, tubes, and ovaries bilaterally.  Indication: [**NAME**] is a 26 y.o. female, Para4004 status post vaginal delivery who requests permanent sterilization by tubal interruption.   Procedure: After satisfactory anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped in a routine fashion for abdominal surgery.  Time out confirmed the patient and procedure.  The abdomen was entered with a transverse incision below the umbilicus.  Stay sutures of 0-Vicryl were placed through the fascia on either side of the incision.  The right fallopian tube was identified by the fimbria and a loop ligated with #1-plain gut suture.  A small defect was made in the mesosalpinx within the loop and each side of the tube double ligated with 0-chromic suture. The intervening segment was excised.  Presence of lumen was confirmed in the excised segment.  Each end of the remaining tube was made hemostatic with cautery.  The exact same procedure was repeated on the left fallopian tube.   The fascia was closed by reapproximating the stay sutures of O-Vicryl.  The skin was closed with a subcuticular stitch of 3-0 monocryl.  Dermabond was applied.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in satisfactory condition.    There were no complications of the procedure.  [**NAME**]  Dictated for E. Wyckoff
