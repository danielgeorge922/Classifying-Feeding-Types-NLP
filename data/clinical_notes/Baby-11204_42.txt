P0020 who delivered via vaginal delivery complicated by a third degree laceration   Details of Procedure:  The patient was placed in lithotomy position. The perineum was cleansed with betadine at the beginning of the repair, periodically throughout the repair, and at the end of the repair. Each free end of the capsule was grasped with an Allis clamp. Four figure of eight sutures of 0- vicryl were used to reapproximate the capsule. A running locking suture of 2-0 chromic was used to close the vaginal tissue defect beginning at the apex and continuing to the hymenal ring. A crown suture was placed. The dead space between either side of the laceration was closed with 2-0 chromic, and the skin was reapproximated using a subcuticular suture of 2-0 vicryl.  At the completion of the procedure, a rectal exam was performed and there were no defects noted. There was no suture in the rectum.   An xray was performed due to incorrect lap count. The Xray resulted as "No evidence for retained sponge markers."  H [**NAME**]  MD
