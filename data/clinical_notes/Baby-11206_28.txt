The patient was verbally consented for a forceps delivery, but while obtaining the forceps, the tracing improved and the fetal head descended to +4 station, so forceps were no longer needed. The anterior shoulder was easily delivered, followed by uncomplicated delivery of the posterior shoulder. The remainder of the infant's body was delivered atraumatically. The umbilical cord was clamped and cut and the infant was passed to pediatricians. All four extremities were moving and the infant cried spontaneously. The placenta was then delivered intact without difficulty. The vagina and perineum were examined and the above noted lacerations were repaired in the usual fashion. Bleeding was minimal and fundus was firm after delivery.   [**NAME**], MD [**DATE**] 7:30 PM
