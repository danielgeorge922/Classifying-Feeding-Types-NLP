Lactation Note The pt was sitting up and holding Raediance [twin B] on her chest when I saw her today. The baby was not STS so I provided encouragement and discussed with her the benefits of practicing STS with both of her daughters. She was receptive to the information. She continued to reply with information that had already been discussed with her and she was very confident with her knowledge base. I reviewed her [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] Breast feeding booklet as she wasn't able to remember some of the information from the previous day. She was able to demonstrate breast massage and hand expression. She understands the importance of breast feeding prior to pumping as she wants to pump to build her milk supply. RaeLynn [twin A] was asleep in the crib and the pt states she gave her formula about two hours prior to my visit because she was still crying after nursing and the pt was concerned about her supply. The pt states that she has concerns R/T a possible tongue in RaeLynn and wants to speak to the pediatrician about it tomorrow.I reinforced the supply and demand process of milk production and encouraged her to allow the baby to nurse unrestricted until she is satisfied. The pt revealed difficulty with obtaining a breast pump from WIC and states she intends to F/U after D/C. In the mean time she states she had to purchase one on her own. I reviewed the details of a nutritive latch, the I&O pages of the resource book and what red flags to report after D/C home. The pt verbalized satisfaction with her breast feeding experience so far and is agreeable to request assistance and support as needed.  [**NAME**] BSN, CLC
