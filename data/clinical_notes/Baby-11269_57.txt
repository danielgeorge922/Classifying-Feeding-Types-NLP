Spoke to ARNP [**NAME**], regarding pt's inquiry about switching the PRN Dilaudid to something different. Pt stated the dilaudid is not truly treating the pain, just makes her lethargic. No other medication to switch to at this time. Will continue to manage patient's pain with scheduled and prn pain meds.
