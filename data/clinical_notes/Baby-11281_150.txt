Liveborn infant female weighing 820 grams with Apgars of 6 and 8.  SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY: placenta, bilateral portions of fallopian tubes  INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 28 y.o. female para 3032 with history of PPROM since 20 weeks who was hospitalized with intermittent bleeding concerning for marginal abruption began to have abdominal pain, contractions, and repetitive variable decelerations. She had received steroids at 24 and 27 weeks. Decision was made to proceed with cesarean delivery and magnesium was restarted for neuroprotection. Due to more prolonged and deeper variables, the procedure was carried out in stat fashion but with ability to obtain quick spinal anesthesia beforehand.   DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfannenstiel incision. The incision was taken down to the level of the fascia which was incised in the midline. The incision was extended laterally in either direction over the rectus muscles. The fascia was dissected off the rectus muscle bluntly. The rectus muscle was divided bluntly. The peritoneum was entered in a clear space bluntly and a few adhesions overlying the anterior lower uterine segment were taken down.  A bladder flap was not created. The lower uterine segment was examined closely and not felt to be adequate to support a low transverse uterine incision. A vertical incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with bandage scissors.  The amniotic fluid was scant but clear.  The above described infant was delivered from the Breech presentation.  The cord was doubly clamped after very brief delay and milking of the cord and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood was obtained for analysis.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap. The placenta was falling apart and with adherent blood clot. The uterus was exteriorized, and the uterine incision was closed in 3 layers, the first a runnig suture of 0-vicryl and the second a running, imbricating suture of 0-vicryl. A third baseball stitch was placed incorporating the uterine serosa.  The right fallopian tube was identified by the fimbria, double ligated with 0-chromic suture and the intervening segment excised.  The left fallopian tube was identified by the fimbria, double ligated with 0-chromic suture and the intervening segment excised.     The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity.  Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision, posterior to the bladder, and in the subfascial area.  The fascia was closed with one suture of 0 Vicryl beginning from one end of the incision and running continuously.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and re-approximated with a running suture of 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with a running subcuticular closure of 3-0 monocryl. Dermabond was applied to the incision.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.
