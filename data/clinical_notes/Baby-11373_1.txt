Undesired fertility  Postoperative Diagnosis: Same, delivered  Operation Performed: Repeat Low Transverse Cesarean Section, Bilateral Parkland tubal ligation  Surgeon: [**NAME**]  Assisstant: [**NAME**]  Anesthesiologist: [**NAME**]  Anesthesiology Assisstant: Sams  Anesthesia: Spinal  Pathology: Portion of bilateral fallopian tubes  EBL: 1000mL  UOP:  500mL  Fluids:  2500cc crystalloid  Findings: Normal uterus, tubes and ovaries bilaterally.  Liveborn infant female weighing 3026 grams with Apgars of 5, 7 and 9.  Indication: [**NAME**] is a 30 y.o. female para 0121 who presented to L&D at 39w3d gestation for scheduled repeat cesarean delivery with bilateral tubal ligation.  She was consented for the above noted procedures then brought back to the operating room.  Procedure: After satisfactory anesthesia, perioperative antibiotics, the patient was prepped and draped in a routine fashion for abdominal surgery.  Time-out confirmed patient and procedure.  The abdomen was entered with a Pfannenstiel approach and dissected down to the level of the fascia with sharp dissection and cautery. The fascia was scored in the midline and extended laterally with sharp dissection. The anterior leaf of the fascia was grasped upwards and the underlying rectus muscle was dissected with sharp and blunt dissection. This was also performed inferiorly. The rectus muscles were separated in the midline and the peritoneum was entered and the underlying uterus exposed.  An Alexis O-ring Retractor was placed to aid visualization. A bladder flap was not created.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and extended laterally with blunt dissection.  Amniotic fluid was clear at the time of ROM.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation with assistance of a Kiwi vaccum.  The cord was clamped and cut and the baby handed to the pediatrician.  Blood for gases and DNA was obtained. An attempt was made to collect cord blood, but the placenta was already separating and only a small sample was obtained. The placenta was delivered with cord traction.  The uterus was then wiped out with a lap.  Ring forceps were placed on the angles of the hysterotomy as well as the upper and lower sections of the uterus.  The uterus was closed in a single layer closure using 0-Monocryl. The uterine incision was hemostatic and uterine tone adequate. Attention was then turned to the tubal ligation. The right fallopian tube was grasped with a Babcock and identified by its fimbriated end.  A small defect was made in the mesosalpinx below the grasped segment.  The tube was then doubly ligated with 0-Gut suture and the intervening segment excised.  The remaining tubal segments were hemostatic.  The same procedure was repeated on the left fallopian tube.  Portions of both tubes were passed off the surgical field and sent to pathology. The Alexis O-Ring retractor was removed.  The fascia was inspected superiorly and inferiorly and was found to be intact and hemostatic.  A Fish visceral retainer was placed below the level of the fascia to ensure safe closure.  The fascia was closed with 2 sutures of 0-Vicryl starting at the angles and running in a continuous fashion to meet the midline. The Fish retractor was removed prior to final fascial  Closure.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and made hemostatic with cautery.  The subcutaneous tissue was closed in 2 layers with 2-0 Vicryl.  The first layer contained interrupted sutures and the second layer was running.  The skin was closed with a running subcuticular stitch of 3-0 Monocryl.  Steri strips and a Bioguard dressing were applied.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.
