OB Cesarean Section Operative Note  Date of Surgery: [**DATE**]  Preoperative Diagnosis:  1.  IUP at 37w0d gestation 2.  History of prior c/s x3 with resulting uterine window 3.  Undesired fertility 4.  Fetal biocoronal craniosynostosis  Postoperative Diagnosis: Same, delivered  Operation Performed:  Repeat Low Transverse Cesarean Section  Surgeon: [**NAME**]  Assisstant: [**NAME**]  Anesthesiologist: [**NAME**]  Anesthesiology Assisstant: [**NAME**]  Anesthesia: Spinal  Pathology: Placenta, Portion of bilateral fallopian tubes  EBL: 700mL  UOP:  100mL  Fluids:  2000cc crystalloid  Findings: Grossly normal uterus with uterine window in the lower uterine segment, Normal tubes and ovaries bilaterally.  Liveborn infant male weighing 3372 grams with Apgars of 8 and 5.  Indication: [**NAME**] is a 26 y.o. female para 2123 who presented to L&D at 37 weeks gestation for scheduled repeat cesarean delivery.  She was consented and taken to the operating room for the above noted procedures.  Prior to surgery it was confirmed that she still desired permanent surgical sterilization.  Procedure: After satisfactory anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped in a routine fashion for abdominal surgery.  Time-out confirmed patient and procedure.  The abdomen was entered with a Pfannenstiel approach and dissected down to the level of the fascia with sharp dissection and cautery. The fascia was scored in the midline and extended laterally with sharp dissection. The anterior leaf of the fascia was grasped upwards and the underlying rectus muscle was dissected with sharp and blunt dissection. The superior segment of fascia was tightly adhered to the underlying rectus muscle, therefore entry to the peritoneal cavity was achieved during separation of these layers.  This inferior segment of fascia was then grawped downwards and the underlying rectus muscle dissected. The bilateral rectus muscles were dissected horizontally to make room for delivery and the underlying uterus was exposed.  A bladder flap was not created due to an extremely thin lower uterine segment with uterine window present.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment (above the prior hysterotomy sites) with a scalpel and extended laterally with blunt dissection.  Amniotic fluid was clear at the time of rupture.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation and gave a spontaneous cry.  The cord was clamped and cut and the baby handed to the pediatrician.  Blood for gases and DNA was obtained then cord blood donatino was performed.  The placenta was delivered with cord traction.  The uterus was then exteriorized and wiped out with a lap. The uterus was closed in a single locked layer using O-Monocryl.  Attention was then turned to the tubal ligation.  A portion of the right fallopian tube was grasped in the mid-isthmic section and a defect made in the nearby mesosalpinx.  The portion of tube was double ligated with 0-Chromic and the intervening segment excised.  Hemostasis of the remaining portions was ensured.  The same procedure was repeated on the left fallopian tube. The peritoneal cavity was suctioned over a clea lap. The uterus was placed back into the peritoneal cavity. The uterine incision was hemostatic and uterine tone adequate. The fascia was inspected superiorly and inferiorly and was found to be intact and hemostatic.  The fascia was closed with 1 suture of 0-Vicryl starting at the angle and running in a continuous fashion to the opposite side. The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and closed with 3 interrupted sutures of 0-Chromic.  The skin was closed with a running subcuticular stitch of 3-0 Monocryl.  Dermabond was applied.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.  [**NAME**], MD
