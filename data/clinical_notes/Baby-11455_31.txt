OB Cesarean Section Operative Note  Date of Surgery: [**DATE**]  Preoperative Diagnosis:  1) IUP at 39w4d 2) PROM  3) Failure to Descend  Postoperative Diagnosis:  Same, plus delivered  Operation Performed: Low Transverse Cesarean Section  Surgeon: Dr. [**NAME**]  Assisstant: Dr. [**NAME**], Dr. [**NAME**]  Anesthesiologist: [**NAME**]  Anesthesiology Assisstant: [**NAME**]  Anesthesia: Epidural  Pathology: None  EBL: 900 mL  UOP:  250mL  Fluids:  1000 cc  Findings: Normal uterus, tubes and ovaries bilaterally.  Liveborn infant male weighing 3692 grams with Apgars of 9 and 9.  Indication: [**NAME**] is a 19 y.o. female para 1001 who presents [**DATE**] with PROM. Her intial exam was [**DATE**]. She was on pitocin for 24 hours following rupture and progressed to C/C/+1 with caput. She pushed for 3 hours with no fetal descent. She was contracting adequately on pitocin. Decision was made to proceed with primary cesarean for failure to descend.   Procedure: After satisfactory anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped in a routine fashion for abdominal surgery.  Time-out confirmed patient and procedure.  The abdomen was entered with a low pfannensteil approach and dissected down to the level of the fascia with sharp dissection and cautery. The fascia was scored in the midline and extended laterally with sharp dissection. The anterior leaf of the fascia was grasped upwards and the underlying rectus muscle was dissected with sharp and blunt dissection. This was also performed inferiorly. The rectus muscles were separated in the midline and the peritoneum was entered and the underlying uterus exposed.  A bladder flap was created.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and extended laterally with blunt dissection.  Amniotic fluid was clear, pt was already ruptured.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation and gave a spontaneous cry.  The cord was clamped and cut and the baby handed to the pediatrician.  Blood for gases and DNA was obtained.  The placenta was delivered with cord traction and manual extraction.  The uterus was exteriorized and wiped out with a lap. The uterus became boggy following delivery despite massage. She was given a total of 60 units of pitocin, 200 mcg of Methergine, and 0.25 mg of Hemabate. Her vitals remained stable and the uterus was firm and hemostatic when the uterus was closed.   The uterus was closed in a single layer closure using 0-Monocryl. The initial layer was a running locked layer.The uterus was placed back into the peritoneal cavity. The uterine incision was hemostatic and uterine tone adequate. The fascia was inspected superiorly and inferiorly and was found to be intact and hemostatic.  The fascia was closed with 1 suture/s of 0-Vicryl starting at the angle and running in a continuous fashion. The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated normal saline.  The skin was closed with 3-0 monocryl.  Dermabond was applied.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.
