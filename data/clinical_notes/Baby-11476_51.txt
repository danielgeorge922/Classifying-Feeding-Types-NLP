Lactation support and assistance: Pt has inverted nipples bilaterrally that turn inward with stimulation. Her breasts are otherwise large and supple without tenderness or pain. No lumps felt with this morning assessment. Pt was shown how to perform breast massage and hand expression and educated about the benefits of the frequent practice along with STS. A hospital grade Breast pump was provided for improving stimulation and facilitating nipple eversion. Pump instructions and hands on demo provided. Cleaning process explained and also demonstrated. The pt had visible colostrum on both nipples and was able to latch the baby with a 20 mm nipple shield on the left breast. The baby had difficulty R/T a posterior frenulum and the pt verbalized that she felt biting on the nipple shield while baby was on her left breast. Colostrum was observed in the nipple shield when the baby finished nursing for 10 minutes. Family members arrived and the baby was placed STS with his grandfather. The pt and the FOB were commended for their successful breastfeeding session and encouraged to call for any further assistance with positioning and latching the baby. The parents were instructed to talk with the Pediatrician about the baby's tongue when they come to assess the baby. This pt lives in [**LOCATION_CITY**] and states that she has WIC. She also has a breastfeeding relative who is close and very supportive. She states that she has a breast pump at home already.  Continue to offer support and assistance as needed. I instructed her about the signs and symptoms of a poor flange fit and instructed her to report any rubbing, burning or pain while pumping and to remove all pump parts to take home when she is D/C'd from the hospital.
