Lactation note I returned to assist with positioning and latch when the FOB called me. The baby was already STS and lying in a cross cradle position facing the right breast. Baby had a big open mouth with the nipple to nose stimulation technique and latched on readily. After a few sucks it was evident that the baby was sucking only on the nipple and not the breast. The mother are normal size breasts that are spaced far apart. Her right nipple is everted with a shorter base than the left side.The chin was held well into the breast but the baby was unable to manuver his neck to suck and swallow effectively. The baby was then repositioned in a football hold on the right breast and again stimulated to open his mouth. The baby was observed to have a deep and asymmetric latch that the mother reported felt better and after several minutes stated that she did not feel any pain. I demonstrated breast compressions and the baby suckled several times with intermittent  swallows. The baby remained calm and relaxed on the mothers breast. I commended her and encouraged her to practice positioning baby in ways that feel good to her and allows the baby to nurse deeply on her breast. She was also encouraged to call as needed. The FOB was present and very supportive. [**NAME**] BSN, CLC
