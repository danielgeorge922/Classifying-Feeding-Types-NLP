Lactation F/U note The pt was sitting up in her rocking chair and was ready to attempt to breast feed her baby. The baby was able to protrude his tongue out of his mouth well past his bottom lip. I did see a posterior frenulum and felt biting on my gloved finger while he was sucking on it. Th pt denies feeling any pain while baby nurses but wants to discuss the benefit of addressing it now with the Pediatrician. Dr [**NAME**] was notified. I assisted the pt with placing the baby STS on her right breast, stimulating a deep latch with the nipple to nose technique and obtaining a nutritive latch. The baby was able to suck several times before losing his latch. We re latched him a few times before discussing her use of a 24 mm nipple shield. I demonstrated the correct way to apply it to her breast and discussed when she should use it on a temporary basis. The baby was asleep by this time, redressed and placed back in his crib for his PKU and Hep B vaccination. The pt was educated about the benefits of breast massage and hand expression as well as the frequent practice of STS. She expressed a desire to attend the [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] mothers breast feeding support group so she was given an invitation to attend. I also instructed her about the Face book breast feeding group and encouraged her to visit the site and to request to join.. I also discussed the risk of using a pacifier to her milk supply. I encouraged her to continue giving her baby her breast milk as her supply has greatly increased. I talked with her about supply and demand and how her milk supply will continue to increase with increasing stimulation from the baby. She has an electric pump and states that she has been pumping while supplementing with formula.  I encouraged lactation F/U R/T her use of the nipple shield and for further assistance as needed with latching and positioning the baby. [**NAME**] BSN, CLC
