Mother has been breast feeding baby today but now is asking for formula. She states she wants to do both. I have been assisting her with latch on this evening and baby has been doing well, waking and cueing, latching and sucking actively. I provided Mum with the breast feeding booklet and the formula preparation pamphlet, both in Spanish. I explained to her the risks of formula feeding and the benefits of breast milk.
