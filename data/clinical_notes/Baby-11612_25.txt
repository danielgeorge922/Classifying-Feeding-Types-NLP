Please see previous CM and SW notes for continuity of care.  SW spoke with pharmacist who stated she is not able to run Medicaid because she does not have a group number.  SW contacted the MOB to see if she had the medicaid card, group number, or able to get it.  MOB stated she did not have the number nor was she able to retrieve the number.  Pharmacy is unable to fill meds do to no insurance information and unable to obtain the information.  SW completed a FAST for Zidovudine Liquid $15.73 and provided Lorette (46208) with the FAST.  SW is waiting on the meds to be filled.
