Dr [**NAME**] @ BS for SVE.  Cervix C/C/+1.  Pt began to push.  Pushing effort was poor secondary to dense epidural.  Dr [**NAME**] @ BS & pushed with pt.  Epidural was turned off.  Assisted pt into high fowlers position to allow her to labor down.  She called for RN assistance & stated she was feeling pressure.  Pushing remained poor.  Assisted her bak to sitting position.  Will begin to push again soon.
