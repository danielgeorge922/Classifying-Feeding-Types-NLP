Lactation note The pt was nipple nursing her baby in a cross cradle position with the baby swaddled in a blanket. The room was cold and the baby felt cool to the touch. I advised her on the risk of nipple trauma and pain resulting from the baby's poor latch and the risk of poor milk transfer and low milk supply. I was able to assist her with repositioning the baby in a football hold and the baby did obtain a deep asymmetric latch. The pt continued to pull back on her breast to try to view the baby. I discussed how pulling back causes the baby to loose her hold and can result in nipple trauma as well. The pt told me that she had 2 minutes left to breast feed her baby so I asked if she was timing her. She states that she was told to only breast feed for 15 minutes on each breast I re educated her about feeding cues, cluster feeding and unrestricted feeding sessions. I encouraged her to continue breast feeding as long as the baby wants to continue. I also encouraged her to offer the second breast to allow the baby more if she wants more. Continue to offer assistance and support as needed. [**NAME**] BSN, CLC
