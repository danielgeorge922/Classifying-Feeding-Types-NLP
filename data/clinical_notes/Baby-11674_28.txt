Disposition: stable  Operative Report and Findings: The patient was taken to the operating room and there under spinal anesthesia her abdomen was draped and prepped in the usual sterile fashion.  A semicircular incision was made under the umbilicus and the various anatomical layers were dissected down to the layer of the parietal peritoneum.The parietal peritoneum was entered with aid of hemostats and Metzenbaum scissors.   There was good hemostasis.  The left fallopian tube was isolated with the aid of singlet forceps and the army navy retractors.  The left fallopian tube was grasped in the mid portion with a balcock clamp.  A hole was cauterized in the mesosalpinx.  The surgeon then tied 2  000 vicryl sutures on either side of the tube and the midportion was resected.  The surgeon then tied a 00 silk suture over the distal part of the proximal stump.  The same procedure was performed on the contralateral side.  There was good hemostasis and the closure of the abdomen was begun.  The parietal peritoneum was then closed with a continuous layer of 000-vicryl.   The fascia was closed with a series of 0-Monocril popoffs starting a suture from both corners of the incision.  The subcutaneous layer was closed with a continuous layer of 000-vicryl.  The skin was closed with a subcuticular stitch of 0000-proline suture.  The incision was covered with a Derma bond dressing.  Hemostasis was excellent at all levels.  The patient tolerated the procedure well under spinal anesthesia.  She was taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.
