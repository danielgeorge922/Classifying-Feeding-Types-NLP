LTM - Continuous Video Electroencephalography Note   Date of Service: [**DATE**]  Indications: status epilepticus  History: 20 y/o F who is 28 weeks pregnant with embolic L MCA stroke in [**DATE**] (due to IV drug abuse), presents with multiple breakthrough sGTCs.  Technical Summary: This is a long-term monitoring EEG performed in the inpatient setting from 05:37 am on [**DATE**] through 06:10 am on [**DATE**] utilizing a 17-channel digital videoEEG system. A standard set of electrodes were applied according to International 10-20 guidelines with dual-lead EKG recording simultaneous cardiac rhythm. Standard techniques of continuous video EEG monitoring including computerized spike and seizure detection software, technologist review and time sampling as well as patient/staff-activated pushbutton alarms were utilized.   Report:  Background Predominant Frequency: continuous diffuse polymorphic delta frequency slowing  Superimposed Frequency: abundant 8 Hz nonposterior dominant alpha activity  Rhythmic or Periodic Patterns: yes, continuous midline and left central LPDs at 1-1.5 Hz, non-evolving, non-fluctuating.  Asymmetry in Amplitude or Frequency: yes, mild asymmetry of cerebral activity decreased left hemisphere  Breach rhythm: none  Epileptiform discharges: yes, LPDs see above.  Seizures: none  Voltage: normal  Variability: yes  Reactivity: unclear  Sleep: none  Stage II sleep transients (K-complexes and spindles): none  Continuity: continuous  EKG: NSR  Clinical interpretation: This 20 minute cvEEG recording in an intubated, sedated patient on an IV midazolam gtt is abnormal due to continuous lateralized periodic discharges (LPDs) over the midline and left central region which is consistent with an acute or subacute disturbance of cerebral function, structural lesion, and/or peri-/post-ictal state involving this region. LPDs are highly associated with partial seizures. There is a mild asymmetry of cerebral activity being of decreased amplitude over the left hemisphere. These findings are consistent with a focal disturbance of cerebral function or focal lesion involving this region. The background shows a severe degree of diffuse slowing with superimposed faster frequencies in the alpha range.  These findings are consistent with a generalized anesthetic pattern due to anesthetic effect.  No seizures were present during the recording. Compared to the previous cvEEG from [**DATE**], there is no significant change.  [**NAME**], M.D.
