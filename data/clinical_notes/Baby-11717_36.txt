At patient's bedside to discuss tubal ligation. Informed her that secondary to staffing issues today on L&D we will unlikely be able to perform her postpartum tubal ligation. Discussed alternative contraception options with patient. At this time, she would like Depo Provera and to discuss an interval procedure (Essure vs BTI) at her postpartum visit. Will administer Depo and D/c patient home.   [**NAME**], MD
