Lactation note The pt was breastfeeding at the time of my visit. She was slumped to the left side with the baby held in a football position. I inquired about her comfort level and she replied that she was not comfortable. I offered assistance which she readily accepted. The baby was held while she repositioned herself and removed her upper clothing to promote STS. The breasts were massaged and colostrum was expressed from both breasts. The nipples are well everted but very reddened and sore. The baby has a frenulum but intermittently is able to extend his tongue. He was noted to bite my gloved finger while sucking rhythmically. The baby was placed back on the left breast in a football hold with a deep latch using the nipple to nose practice. The baby was observed by both parents to suck consistently with his lips at a 90 degree angle. Pillows were used to improve the baby's body alignment and the mothers comfort. She reported a comfortable experience and felt the baby was nursing better. I reviewed the [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] breastfeeding booklet with the parents and provided them with my contact information.  [**NAME**] BSN, CLC
