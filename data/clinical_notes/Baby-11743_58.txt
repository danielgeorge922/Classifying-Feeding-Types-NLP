This note was copied from the chart of BOY/Lizbeth Stoutepacheco. MOB has been to bedside to breastfeed baby throughout night.  Baby is 35 weeks and needs head support.  Demonstrated cross cradle hold but MOB did not like this hold.  Ask parents to come back at a certain time and they are 30 min to 1.5 hours later than the requested time.  She has not pumped that much extra milk.  (2 small vials totaling 5ml attempted to give in bottle this am.)  She is still nursing her 14month old to sleep.  Expected her milk to be more but maybe she just doesn't respond well to the pump.  Pt did have 1 emesis overnight.  He is also still on IV fluids.  Did have 1 excellent breastfeed and one good one overnight.  Encouraged her to pump this am after the poor breastfeeding attempt.   [**NAME**], RN, CLC
