This note was copied from the chart of BABY/[**NAME**]. Visited pt at her bedside - currently breastfeeding infant on left breast using cradle hold with adequate latch, pt denies pain.  She states breastfeeding has been difficult, painful and exhausting overnight and that she has only been using the left breast due to nipple soreness from her initial feeding on the right side.  She states she has also been pumping and syringe feeding colostrum to infant as well.  Bilateral breasts soft, round with slightly everted nipples, right nipple noted to be bifurcated/stipled, both nipples pink, no breakdown noted.  Left nipple noted to have compression stripe when removed from breast.  With pt's permission I assisted her to latch infant to right breast in clutch position with a deep, asymmetrical latch.  Pt reports initial discomfort that becomes tolerable after a couple of minutes of suckling.  Reviewed positioning and latch tips with pt, assisted to break latch and watched pt re-latch infant well, again with minimal discomfort.  Also reviewed hand expression with pt - noted to have large drops of colostrum bilaterally.  Discussed keeping infant skin to skin, feeding frequency/duration, burping, and management of engorgement/ rapid milk onset after discharge.  Also reviewed resources available to pt after discharge and provided an invitation to our mother's support group.  Pt verbalized understanding and expressed increased confidence with latching infant bilaterally.  Will continue to support her breastfeeding goals.
