Pt wanting to breast feed baby. Her nipples a flat and the right one tends to invert. In L&D baby latched and sucked a few times only using a nipple shield. His blood sugars are stable apart from the initial one of 41. Mum is in a lot of pain and would prefer to pump for this time. Pump set up, I instructed family regarding disassembling for washing all the parts and reassembling. Bowl and detergent provided. She pumped for 15 minutes and got 9 ml colostrum which we gave baby in a syringe. I showed her breast massage and hand expression and encouraged her to do this.
