Date of Surgery: [**DATE**]  PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  1) Intrauterine pregnancy at 41 weeks 2) Arrest of dilation 3) Chorioamnionitis  POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Same + Delivered  PROCEDURE:  1) Primary low transverse cesarean section  SURGEON: [**NAME**] ASSISTANTS: [**NAME**]  ANESTHESIOLOGIST: [**NAME**] ANESTHESIA ASSISTANT: [**NAME**]  ANESTHESIA: Epidural  EBL: 700 mL  FLUID REPLACEMENT: 1000 mL  FINDINGS: Normal uterus, tubes and ovaries bilaterally. Small 2cm pedunculated fibroid on anterior uterine wall. Liveborn infant male weighing 3427 grams with Apgars of 7 and 9.  SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY: Placenta  INDICATIONS: 22 y.o. para @ 41w0d admitted in labor and augmented with pitocin. She progressed to 5cm dilation and had arrest of dilation despite adequate contractions for > 6 hours. She developed chorioamnionitis and was taken to the operating room for cesarean delivery.   DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfannenstiel incision.  A bladder flap was created.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with traction.  The amniotic fluid was clear.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut, and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatricians. A sample of cord and cord blood were obtained for analysis.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.  The uterus was exteriorized, and the corners of the uterine incision were taken in figures of 8 with 0-vicryl and the uterus was closed in a single layer of 0 Vicryl.  The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity.  The fascia was closed with a suture of 0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated with saline. The skin was closed with a subcuticular stitch of 4-0 Monocryl.  Dermabond was applied to the incision.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.  Dictated for Dr. [**NAME**], MD  I was present for the entire case.  I reviewed the resident's note and made appropriate corrections and additions to it.
