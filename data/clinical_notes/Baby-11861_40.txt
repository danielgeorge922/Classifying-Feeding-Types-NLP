Lactation Note The pt eported that she has changed her mind about breastfeeding and wants to give formula instead. I inquired about what had made her change her mind and she verbalized increased pain in her abdomen and that she can't deal with that and her breasts too. She denies any concerns or questions. I gave her my best wishes and congratulated her and the FOB again on the baby's birth. [**NAME**] BSN, CLC
