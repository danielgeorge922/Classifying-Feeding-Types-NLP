S: I met with patient at request of OB-GYN. Ms. [**NAME**] is now in post partum recovery. She is ready for discharge to home. She did get PO Dilaudid post delivery. She said that she didn't want it for pain. It didn't help much anyway. She c/o no withdrawal while on Subutex. Her last Dilaudid dose was this am. She is due for Subutex this afternoon prior to discharge.  Today, she is enthusiastic in getting more help. She says that she is very desirous to continue "getting better. I want to keep my kids." She inquired about Meridian.  I spoke to her about FRC. She says that she has the money to get treatment there if she qualifies. She was given the contact phone number of FRC..  She received direct instructions on the use for Suboxone. She agrees to use as prescribed. She was written for a prescription of Suboxone 8/2mg SL once daily starting am [**DATE**] for 7 days.  I gave the prescription to [**NAME**] RN after I showed it to Ms. [**NAME**] in [**NAME**]'s presence. It is to be given on discharge home. Likewise, I spoke with Dr. [**NAME**] about this treatment plan I discussed this case with Dr. [**NAME**] on the phone who agrees with the plan.
