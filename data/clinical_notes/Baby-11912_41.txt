Lactation Note The pt was apologetic when I met with her this morning verbalizing that she felt so tired last night and had decided to offer her baby formula, but she wants to continue breastfeeding and pumping in preparation for her return to work in six weeks. I assured her of my role to support her choice and to offer assistance in helping her meet her goals. She verbalized her intent to attend the mothers breastfeeding support group. I reminded her of the community lactation resources and their contact information in her breastfeeding booklet. She was also given a list of the current employee pumping rooms. The pt states that she is ready to go home and is waiting for her D/C instructions. I congratulated her new baby's arrival and her choice to breast feed her baby. [**NAME**] BSN, CLC
