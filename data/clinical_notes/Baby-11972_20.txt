This note was copied from the chart of BABY/[**NAME**]. Lactation note:  In to see dyad. Mother very tired. Reports not sleeping at all last night d/t cluster feeding behavior and fussiness of infant. Also reports supplementing x1 via syringe. C/o very sore nipples.  Infant down 5% weight from birth. Enocuraged mother to supplement with her own milk vs formula if she chooses to supplement. I provided mother a container and syringe to use--encouraged her to call for assistance wtih hand expression and syringe feeding as needed.   Breasts soft round Nipples more everted than yesterday, short, intact, non damaged Infant tongue-short frenulum noted but nipple remains round most of the time after feeds, per mother.  Assisted mother to bf infant, as showing feeding cues. Mother positioned infant in cross cradle hold on left breast. Good latch noted. Mother c/o soreness greastest in the initial latch, but persisted throughout. Infant with good rhythmic sucking. I discussed my concern re:sore nipples at only 2 days after delivery may be due to shallow latch d/t short nipples vs infant pulling nipples more everted vs tongue tie issue.  In breastfeeding book discussed community resources including mary and teresa and encouraged to seek appt if soreness continues to persist past a few days post d/c, as soreness is not normal and may lead to low milk supply.   Encouraged bf on demand with unrestricted access to the breast with continued STS. Discussed infant feeding 8-10 times in 24 hours and normal cluster feeding behavior after the first 24 hours. Discouraged pacifiers, formula or artificial nipples due to the risk of low milk supply. Left phone number to call me for next feed or for any problems, questions, or concerns.
