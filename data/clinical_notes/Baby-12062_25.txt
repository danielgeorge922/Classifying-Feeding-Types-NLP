Lactation F/U note The pt was asleep when I visited her room this morning. The FOB related her night time breastfeeding experience stating that after nursing a long time the baby remained hungry with active feeding cues so she requested to supplement with formula. He confirmed her prior breastfeeding history and inability to produce milk after two weeks with their first child and the baby's notable weight loss. I instructed him to relay my visit information to the pt and to encourage her to call me when she is awake and ready.  Plan: Reinforce breast massage and hand expression. Introduce the option to pump for added stimulus and encourage the pt to continue her practice of frequent STS and feeding on demand only supplementing after breastfeeding first.  [**NAME**] BSN, CLC
