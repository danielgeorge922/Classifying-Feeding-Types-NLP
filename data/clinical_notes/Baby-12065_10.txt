Lactation note: The pt and baby were not available when I attempted to meet them this afternoon. I spoke with the floor nurse and requested that my contact information be provided and the pt encouraged to call when she is ready for a lactation visit. Baby is having a circumcision performed and the pt requested time for a nap. The nurse reports that she is not aware of any current lactation issues, concerns or complications.  Will F/U as needed.
