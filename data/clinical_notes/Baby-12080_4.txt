Prior to the procedure, it was confirmed that she desired permanent sterilization.  DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfannenstiel incision.  An incision was made in the skin with a #10 blade and was carried to the fascia.  The fascia was then scored sharply in the midline.  The fascial incision was extended bilaterally with Mayo scissors.  The anterior rectus sheath was dissected with scissors and electrocautery off the rectus abdominis superiorly and inferiorly.  The peritoneum was entered bluntly.  A bladder flap was created.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with digital traction.  The amniotic fluid was clear and voluminous.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation with the assistance of a Kiwi vacuum extractor, no pop-offs occurred.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood were obtained for analysis.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.  The uterus was exteriorized, and the uterine incision was closed in one layer of a running locked suture of 0 Vicryl.    The right fallopian tube was identified by the fimbria, double ligated with 0-chromic suture and the intervening segment excised.  The left fallopian tube was identified by the fimbria, double ligated with 0-chromic suture and the intervening segment excised.    The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity.  Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision and in the subfascial area.  The fascia was closed with a single running suture of 0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissue was closed with a running suture of 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with a running subcuticular closure of 3-0 Monocryl.  Dermabond was applied to the incision.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  A debriefing was held at the end of the procedure; all counts were correct and no outstanding issues were identified.  The patient left for the recovery room in good condition.
