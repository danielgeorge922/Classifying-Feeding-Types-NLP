Went in to check on pt. Pt sitting on edge of bedding trying to stand up with epidural in place. Instructed pt to stay in bed and reminded her that she has an epidural and can not get up out of bed because she could fall and get hurt. Pt laid back down in the bed and stated she understood the risks of getting out of bed and would not get up out of bed. Pt will continue to be monitored.
