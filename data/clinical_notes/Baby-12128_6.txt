ENDOCRINOLOGY PLAN OF CARE NOTE  I briefly saw patient myself (patient was off floor when attempted to see with attending), being discharged today.  She reports not administering any boluses per CHO since she is only eating about 20g carbohydrates per meal and finds that her blood sugars drop after breastfeeding, which she is currently doing every 2 hours.    We have reviewed her blood sugars:   Glucometer readings from [**DATE**]-[**DATE**]: TimeBG [**LOCATION_ZIP**]9 Dinner 81 (ate 20g CHO without coverage) -> 132 an hour later and started breastfeeding 2022129 2045102 233978 050085 (breast fed at 0600) 070099 081580  Patient was off the floor again when attempted to discuss reduction in her settings, however I did communicate to her to incrementally reduce her basal rate if she continued to experience blood sugars below 90.  Communicated to RN to inform patient to decrease basal rate to 0.7 units/hr when she returns to floor (last reduced to 0.775 from 0.8 this morning).  Final pump settings: Basal 0.7 units/hr BolusCHO 1:16g IS 50 Target 100 +/- 10  Thank you for allowing us to participate in Brittany Dsilva's care.  F/u Endocrine outpatient on [**DATE**].
