Lactation Note The pt was sitting in her chair by the window with her baby draped across her lap. The baby was undressed as she had just completed a breastfeeding session. The baby was asleep and very calm.  Assessment: I was unable to perform a breast assessment or baby assessment at this time. The pt denies any breast or nipple pain. She reports not having enough milk and is supplementing with formula for that reason. She admits to performing hand expression but not breast massage. Intervention: The pt was educated about the benefits of breast massage, hand expression and the frequent practice of STS. Frequent demand feedings in response to feeding cues was discussed and encouraged with a minimum of 8-10 breast feeding occurences in each 24 hour cycle. The [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] Breastfeeding book was provided and reviewed. Lactation F/U resources were recommended for ongoing support and assistance and contact information was noted in the back of the book. Monitoring of adequate nutrition using the baby's weight, frequency and duration of feedings, and adequate elimination patterns each day was emphasized and close observation encouraged. The baby's daily feeding record was noted and instructions for utilizing it as a tracking system for progress at home was recommended. The pt's questions were addressed while the risks of supplementing with formula and using pacifiers was discussed. The pt was encouraged to continue demand feedings without time restrictions and supplement only after the baby has completed her feeding.     Plan: Continue to provide lactation support and assistance to help the pt meet her breastfeeding goals. Reinforce cluster feeding as a newborn behavior that increases breast stimulation, increased milk production and typically indicates a growth spurt.   [**NAME**] BSN, CLC
