Thick adhesion band in mid lower uterine segment. Significant scar tissue of fascia to anterior abdominal wall and underlying rectus muscle.  Liveborn infant female weighing 3492 grams with Apgars of 9 and 9.  SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY: none  INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 23 y.o. female para 3013 with history of prior cesarean x 2 presented for repeat cesarean delivery as scheduled at 39 weeks gestation. She declined permanent sterilization by tubal interruption.  DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through her prior incision. The incision was taken down to the level of the fascia which was incised in the midline. The incision was extended laterally in either direction over the rectus muscles. The fascia was dissected off the rectus muscle superiorly and then inferiorly as much as we were able but noted to have dense connective tissue scarring in this area. Due to difficulty separating the fascia from the underlying rectus muscle, the fascia unintentionally had a button-hole effect, approximately 5 cm in length which was repaired with several interrupted sutures of 0-vicryl and integrity of the fascia was assured.  The rectus muscle was divided bluntly. The peritoneum was entered in a clear space bluntlyly.  A bladder flap was created in essence by taking down a thick adhesion band from the mid anterior lower uterine segment where pulled up.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with the surgeon's fingers.  The amniotic fluid was clear.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood was obtained for analysis.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.  The uterus was exteriorized, and the uterine incision was closed in 2 layers, the first a running suture of 0-vicryl and the second a running, imbricating suture of 0-vicryl. The hysterotomy on the left side extended down vertically very slightly and closure of the incision was started from the inferior-most aspect on that side with running, locking sutures then continuing on to the remainder of the transverse hysterotomy closure with running, nonlocking suture.  The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity.  Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision, posterior to the bladder, and in the subfascial area.  The fascia was closed with two sutures of 0 Vicryl beginning from either end of the incision and meeting in the midportion.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and not reapproximated given small amount of subcutaneous tissue present in this region of her prior scar.  The skin was closed with a running subcuticular closure of 3-0 monocryl.  Benzoin, Steri-Strips, and a sterile Biogard dressing were applied to the incision.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.    Dictated for Dr. [**NAME**]
