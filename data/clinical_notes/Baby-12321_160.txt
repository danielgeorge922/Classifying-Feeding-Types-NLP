To room due to patient's request to sign out AMA.   The patient reports that she wants to go home to be with her baby. I discussed with the patient that I would not recommend her signing out AMA due to her recent superimposed preeclampsia, diastolic heart failure, pulmonary edema, and pulmonary hypertension. I discussed with her that the risks of signing out against medical advice include worsening blood pressure control, stroke, seizure, heart failure, pulmonary edema, myocardial infarction, temporary or permanent neurologic injury, or death. The patient expressed understanding of these risks and continued to insist on signing out AMA.   The patient voluntarily signed the AMA form which was witnessed by her nurse [**NAME**] and placed in the chart.  [**NAME**] M.D.
