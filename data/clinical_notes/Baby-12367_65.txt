Infant back from frenotomy, very sleepy.  Unable to assist with successful sustained latch due to sleepiness, even while skin to skin.  Pt thinks she may be discharged home this afternoon.  Encouraged her to call for assistance with next feeding, but if that doesn't happen before discharge: attempt to latch to bare breast with each feeding, if unsuccessful, use 20 mm shield ( showed how to apply). Discussed importance of pumping with each feeding if using shield.  RN set up breast pump at bedside earlier: reviewed use and care of pump, including use of hand pump attachment.  Pt verbalized understanding.  Reviewed poc with [**NAME**], RN as well.
