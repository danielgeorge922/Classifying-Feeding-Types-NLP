Attestation  I saw and evaluated the patient. I reviewed and agree with the findings and plan as documented in the note. I reviewed the patient's history. I discussed this patient with the ARNP/PA. The patient required the following critical interventions: evaluating patient, reviewing labs and imaging, discussing with consulting physicians, critical considerations of the case, discussing with patient and/or patient's family, documenting in chart and management of IV medications and drips. Comments: The patient was BIBA after she states a tree fell on top of her while shopping at a car dealership. She had (+) LOC. A c-collar was placed by ED staff after EMS delivered patient. After intial assessment of the patient's history and exam revealing hematoma on right side of scalp, bruising to right chest wall, abdomen and flank, the patinet was brought back into the trauma bay. A trauma alert was promptly called and OB, orthopedics and trauma surgery presented to bedside.   Patient denied any vaginal bleeding or leakage of fluid.  The patient had a negative FAST exam. She was hemodynamically stable as trauma surg and Ob also evaluated her.The patient had a GCS of 15 and primary complained of right sided rib pain. Her lung sounds were, clear equal and bilateral and I did not hear any wheezing. Pupils were 3mm and equally reactive. There was no hemotympany. No significant gross deformities were noted to arms or legs. The patient complained primarily of right sided rib pain, while in the ED. Her intial Chest XR was negative for any fracture or sign of pneumothorax.   In conjunction with OB and trauma surgery, decision was made not to get an immediate body CT scan given patient never became hypotensive, tachycardic or showed other signs of hemodynamic instability. Do not want to expose a fetus to such excessive amounts of radiation, unless the clinical situation indicates a life threatening abdominal or intrathoracic bleed for either mom/fetus.  At 17:00, I spoke personally to patient, she had GCS of 15 and was asking for something for rib pain, so morphine was ordered for her. Shortly after this, I signed off care of the patient. OB, trauma surgery and oncoming ED team were all aware of patient. The final disposition pends CT head/c-spine results and a full OB and trauma surgery reassment of the patient's response to therapy.
