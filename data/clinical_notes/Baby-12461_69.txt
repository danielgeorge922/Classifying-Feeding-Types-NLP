Lactation: Mom state that she has been pumping but nothing is coming out. Breast massage and hand expression taught and she was instructed to massage before pumping and hand express after pumping.  I also changed the 27 mm flange to the 24 mm flange and taught how to use the manual pump and clean the pumping kit. I gave her a storage  Bottle. I was able to hear the NICU Md talk to mom about the baby's prognosis and she will be updated as things come up. Mom encouraged to call the lactation office if she has any concerns.  Mom will get NICU  Kit from the NICU.
