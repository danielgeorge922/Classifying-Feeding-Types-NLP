Discussed at board rounds with Dr. [**NAME**] this evening. Will keep patient on CEFM overnight with plan for delivery by repeat cesarean in am, sooner with FHT concerns. Can re-evaluate FHT again later for possible nubain for pain control (currently with minimal variability) or consider epidural if still in significant pain in anticipation of delivery tomorrow.
