Pt called out. Pt requests foley catheter to be removed. Explained to pt that she has to void within 8 hours and that with the pain she is complaining of 8/10, that she is at increased risk for falls along with her IV with running fluids. Pt verbalized understanding. Pt started to fall asleep mid-explanation of information. Pt appears very tired and then states, "I just want to go to sleep." Asked pt if it was okay to first let the catheter completely drain and get her pain under control before removal. Pt stated, "thats fine." Will continue to monitor.
