Upon discussion with Drs. Greer and [**NAME**], will dose with methadone to prevent withdrawal given two missed doses in last 48 hours, as withdrawal from methadone could be anticipated within 48 hours of last dose.   Her high BPs may be related to either gestational hypertension versus opioid withdrawal. For now will continue to trend blood presures in Triage and evaluate with preeclampsia panel. Will also consent for repeat cesarean delivery with BTI at the time of cesarean. If blood pressures return to normotensive range and patient doing well, can anticipate discharge for cesarean (to be scheduled for Tuesday). If blood pressures persistently in hypertensive range, will admit to HRO. Will plan for repeat cesarean on Tuesday.   [**NAME**], M.D.
