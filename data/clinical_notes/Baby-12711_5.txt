Scant filmy adhesions between bladder and anterior lower uterine segment. No intra-abdominal adhesions. Increased vascularity in anterior uterus both near fundus and in lower uterine segment. Liveborn infant male weighing 2602 grams with Apgars of 8 and 9. Placenta was removed intact with manual traction.  SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY:  Bilateral segments of fallopian tube  INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 35 y.o. female para 2214 at 35w6d with history of four prior cesarean deliveries presenting for scheduled repeat cesarean with possible cesarean-hysterectomy. Patient is at increased risk for morbidly adherent placenta given her history and appearance of placenta and uterus on imaging. Patient does not desire future fertility given risks of multiple cesarean deliveries and associated morbidity and mortality.  DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table. A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed. After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. A foley catheter was inserted and remained in place during the procedure. A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered through a midline vertical incision. The incision was taken down to the level of the fascia which was incised in the midline. The incision was extended inferiorly and superiorly over the rectus muscles. The rectus muscle was divided sharply. The peritoneum was entered in a clear space sharply. A bladder flap was attempted but abandoned due to increased vascularity of the uterus. A classical (vertical) incision was made in the uterine fundus anteriorly with a scalpel and the incision was extended slightly with manual traction. The amniotic fluid was scant but clear. The above described infant was in cephalic position, but due to the superior location of the hysterotomy the infant was delivered from the breech presentation. The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood was obtained for analysis.  The hysterotomy edges were clamped with ring forceps. The hysterotomy edges were secured with a running locked suture of 0 Chromic. The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the umbilical cord, and the placenta was closely inspected and noted to be intact. There was minimal bleeding from the uterus at this point. The hysterotomy was closed in a single layer with a running suture of 0 Chromic.    The left fallopian tube was identified to its fimbriated end and a defect was made in a relatively avascular portion of the mesosalpinx underlying the mid isthmic portion of the tube. A segment of the mid isthmic portion of the tube was ligated with two sutures of 0 Chromic suture and the intervening portion of the tube excised and handed off the field; adequate hemostasis was assured. The exact same procedure was performed on the opposite side after identifying that tube to its fimbriated end; again, adequate hemostasis was assured. Patient expressed desire for salpingectomy to reduce risk of fallopian tube carcinoma so the fimbriated ends of the fallopian tubes were excised with handheld Ligasure device. The fimbriated ends of fallopian tube were handed off the field to be labeled and sent to Pathology.  Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision, in the adnexa, posterior to the bladder, and in the subfascial area. The fascia was closed with two sutures of 0 Vicryl beginning from either end of the incision and meeting in the midportion. The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and re-approximated with a running suture and interrupted sutures of 3-0 Vicryl. The skin was closed with a running subcuticular closure of 3-0 Monocryl. Dermabond mesh tape (Prineo) was applied to the incision. The vagina was cleared of clots. All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.
