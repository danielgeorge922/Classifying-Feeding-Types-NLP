Date of Surgery: [**DATE**]  PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  1) Undesired fertility  POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  1) Undesired fertility  PROCEDURE:  1) Parkland postpartum bilateral tubal interruption  SURGEON: [**NAME**] ASSISTANT: [**NAME**]  ANESTHESIOLOGIST: Sessions ANESTHESIA ASSISTANT: Radmall  ANESTHESIA: Spinal  EBL: Trace  FLUID REPLACEMENT: 1000 mL  FINDINGS: Normal uterus; normal tubes and ovaries bilaterally.   SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY:  Segments from each tube  INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 25 y.o. female para 3225 who requests sterilization.  Patient understands this is a permanent procedure.  DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE:   The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  The abdominal cavity was entered through a small, transverse infraumbilical incision.  The left fallopian tube was identified to its fimbriated end and a defect was made in a relatively avascular portion of the mesosalpinx underlying the mid isthmic portion of the tube.  A segment of the mid isthmic portion of the tube was ligated with two sutures of 0 Chromic suture and the intervening portion of the tube was excised and handed off the field; adequate hemostasis was assured.  The exact same procedure was performed on the opposite side after identifying that tube to its fimbriated end; again, adequate hemostasis was assured.  The fascia was closed with a running suture of 0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissue was reapproximated with 0 vicryl.  The skin incision was closed with a running subcuticular suture of monocryl.  The patient was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.  All counts were correct at the end of the procedure.  [**NAME**], MD OB/GYN PGY1
