BP 162/110 ( manually with pt in semi fowler's position) . PT had walked in the hallway  30 minutes ago and said she walked around the unit 4 times. Pt denies having headache blurred vision or nausea, reflexes WNL. I will have pt lie on her left side for 15 minutes and will recheck BP manually in 15 minutes
