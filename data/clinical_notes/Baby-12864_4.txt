Using interpreter #[**ID**] "Anna" spoke to pt regarding cord blood donation, pain management, and how to use the call light/when to call. Obtained verbal consent for cord blood donation and informed pt that we will also need her written consent. Informed pt to call us if she feels increased pressure or the urge to push. Pt verbally agrees. Pt denies the need for epidural and states she would like to deliver naturally. Will continue to monitor.
