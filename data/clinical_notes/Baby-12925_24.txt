FHT demonstrated baseline 150 with min variability, no accels, and 3 late decels. Patient was repositioned and oxygen reapplied. There was a period when FHT demonstrated a series of deeper late decels. I went to room to consent for cesarean and blood transfusion, FHT now Cat 1 with mod variability and accels.  Consents signed for cesarean delivery and blood transfusion. The indications, risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed with the patient. Patient expresses verbal understanding of the risks of cesarean including hemorrhage, infection, and injury to vital organs. Patient expresses verbal understanding of the risks of blood transfusion including small risk of transmission of HIV or Hepatitis B/C through transfusion. Consent forms were signed, witnessed, and placed in patient's chart.  Plan:  Recheck SVE at 2030 and proceed with cesarean if no change. May need to proceed with cesarean if necessary for FHT sooner than that.  [**NAME**], MD
