Date of Surgery: [**DATE**]  PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  1) Intrauterine pregnancy at 40 weeks 2) Arrest of dilation 3) Non reassuring fetal heart rate tracing 4) Prior c/s x 1  POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  1) Intrauterine pregnancy at 40 weeks 2) Arrest of dilation 3) Non reassuring fetal heart rate tracing 4) Prior c/s x 1 5) TOLAC  PROCEDURE:  1) Low transverse cesarean section  SURGEON: [**NAME**] ASSISTANT: [**NAME**]  ANESTHESIOLOGIST: [**NAME**] ANESTHESIA ASSISTANT: Sams  ANESTHESIA: Epidural  EBL: 800 mL  FLUID REPLACEMENT: 800 mL  FINDINGS: Normal uterus, tubes and ovaries bilaterally.  Liveborn infant male weighing 2864 grams with Apgars of 8 and 9. The patient underwent induction of labor with foley bulb, pitocin, and AROM and remained at 4 cm cervical dilation for 24 hours. During this time the FHT demonstrated minimal variability with intermittent late appearing decelerations. The decision was made to proceed with a repeat cesarean section.  SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY: None  INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 23 y.o. female para 2012 at 40w4d GA who was admitted for scheduled induction of labor in the setting or a prior cesarean section.   DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfannenstiel incision.  The subcutaneous tissue was incised with the scalpel. The fascia was scored with the scalpel. The fascial incision was extended bilaterally with curved mayo scissors. The fascia was dissected away from the rectus muscle with blunt dissection, electrocautery, and curved mayo scissors. The rectus muscle was divided at the midline and then laterally on the left. The left lateral division was made due to very thickened peritoneum located at the midline. The peritoneum was entered with Metzenbaum scissors at the left lateral division of the rectus muscle. The rectus muscle and the peritoneum was divided toward the midline with electrocautery. The peritoneal incision was then extended with gentle traction. A bladder flap was created.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended with traction. The hysterotomy was extended superiorly at bilateral angles.  The amniotic fluid was clear.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood were obtained for analysis.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.  The uterus was exteriorized, and the uterine incision was closed in a single layer, a running locking suture of 0-Monocryl.   The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity.  Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision and in the subfascial area.  The fascia was closed with a single running suture of 0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissue was closed with two layers of running suture of 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with a running subcuticular closure of 3-0 Monocryl.  Dermabond was applied to the incision.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.  Complications: none  [**NAME**] M.D.  I was present for the entire case.  I reviewed the resident's note and made appropriate corrections and additions to it.
