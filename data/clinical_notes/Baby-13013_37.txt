Received pt from L&D. Infant bands verified x2 RNs. MOB declined my checking for continued firm fundus. Per L&D nurse fundus firm and lochia adequate. Will recheck at a later time. MOB asked if I would be caring for infant when father returned to work later this morning. MOB became slightly upset when I informed that we encouraged parents caring for their infants to form bonds and become comfortable caring for baby. MOB requesting I care for baby stating "I will have help for baby at home". Due to infant's low blood glucose and mother's insistance I be the one to feed baby, infant transferred to newborn nursery.
