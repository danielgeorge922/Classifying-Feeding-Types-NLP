Pt received to my care for day shift. Kristine is resting in bed and c/o incisional pain [**DATE**]. I medicated her with Percocet 10 mg. Assessment completed. Wound open to air, clean and dry. She is wearing a binder and this gives her increased comfort. No c/o HA or visual changes. Call light within reach, husband at bedside.
