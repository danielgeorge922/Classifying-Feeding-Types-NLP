Patient called RN into room stating that she would like a pacifier. She states that infant is nursing often and will go to breast and fall asleep. Reviewed with patient and grandmother risks of using pacifier too early- masking of infant feeding cues, not enough stimulation to the breast for milk production and nipple confusion between pacifier and breast. Pacifier should be discouraged until breastfeeding is well established. Encouraged patient that it is normal for infant to breastfeed often. Explained cluster feeding and that allowing infant to go to breast with feeding cues provides proper stimulation for milk production. Also assisted patient in latching infant to R breast in football hold with nipple shield. Infant obtained good latch with 1-2 attempts and began sucking rhythmically. Audible swallowing heard. Infant then became sleepy, demonstrated to patient breast compression, which caused infant to begin breastfeeding again. Patient encouraged and was able to demonstrate as well. Encouraged patient to call RN if any other questions or concerns. She agreed.
