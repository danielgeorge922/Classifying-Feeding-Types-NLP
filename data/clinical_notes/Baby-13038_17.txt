Lactation note Baby was completing her hearing test at the time I spoke to the pt this morning. She had a bottle of formula on the bedside table so after introducing myself and my role I inquired about how breastfeeding was going and about the use of formula for supplementing. The pt reported to me that she does not want to breastfeed her baby. I assured her of my support regarding her choice for her baby's nutrition. I notified Dr [**NAME**] of her report to me.
