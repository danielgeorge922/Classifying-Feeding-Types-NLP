Assessment: Pt seems very anxious, states breastfeeding was quite painful overnight .  Expresses concern re: infant not able to stay deeply latched during feedings.  Infant is currently being taken to procedure room with Peds team/ FOB for frenotomy.  Breasts are soft, well-developed.  Nipples are everted and intact, appear pinched.  Pt was shown how to hand express her breasts, and drops of colostrum noted bilaterally. Infant returned to room post-frenotomy during visit, actively extending tongue/rooting.  Intervention: Assisted pt to latch infant in clutch hold on right breast with deep latch and rhythmic suck.  Pt reports nipple discomfort initially with latch, transitioning to a tolerable soreness within a couple of minutes.  Discussed importance of asymmetrical, chin-led latch, as well as allowing infant to determine feeding times by observing infant for feeding cues.  Instructed to allow infant to finish on one breast, using breast compressions to maximize feeding time before switching to second breast at each feeding.  Reviewed nipple care, typical cluster feeding behavior, infant stomach capacity and expected output for infant.  Also discussed managing possible milk oversupply during milk onset. Discouraged use of pacifiers or artificial nipples until breastfeeding is well-established, around 3-4 weeks of age. Encouraged maximizing skin to skin time with infant over the next several days as well.  Infant finished on right, talked pt through burping, began rooting again and assisted to latch infant to left breast in clutch position, again with deep latch.  Before end of feeding, pt was able to independently latch infant on both breasts with minimal discomfort.   Pt has a copy of the [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] Breastfeeding book and made aware of resources available to her after discharge. States they plan to [**NAME**] for a home visit after discharge.  Pt plans to return to work after 12 weeks. Has already obtained a pump and reviewed recommended milk storage guidelines.   Plan: Will continue to support pt's breastfeeding goals. Encouraged her to call for assistance as needed, and left contact information. Pt verbalized understanding.
