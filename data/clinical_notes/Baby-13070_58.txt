Problem: Knowledge Deficit Goal: Understands dx, medications & necessary therapeutic regimen Outcome: Ongoing Discussed pt safety and pts meds. Offered pain meds but pt denies pain. Discussed s/s to report to RN. Discussed b/p still being elevated but pt still doesn't seem to grasp the seriousness of her condition. She wants to go home and is convinced that her b/p will stablize after her discharge and doesn't understand why we are keeping her here. Pt still wants to go home despite being told that elevated b/ps like this could lead to a stroke even at a young age. Discussed smoking cessation and offered to get an order for nicotine patch but pt declined. Discussed limiting sodium intake and resting and limiting phone calls and visitors to promote rest but pt was not happy about or open to those topics. Discussed that diet, rest and smoking cessation will not fix what is causing her elevated b/ps but it could help and that her baby is getting the nicotine through her breastmilk and that she should consider smoking cessation for her, again the pt was not open to this idea. Discussed the pts POC and frequency of v/s, pt appears to be becoming more hostile in her answers and facial expressions. Will continue to monitor.
