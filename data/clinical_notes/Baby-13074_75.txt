While helping the pt to the restroom, the pt become very dizzy and weak and nearly passed out on the way to the bed. Pt complained of ringing in the ears and not being able to hear my voice clearly. Pt also complained of pain at the front of her pelvis which was mostly relieved upon emptying her bladder. Possibly low H&H. MD Preiss paged, awaiting response. Pt now in bed resting and she was given pain med. Will continue to monitor.
