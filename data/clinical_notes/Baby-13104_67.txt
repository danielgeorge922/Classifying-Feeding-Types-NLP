Baby A (intact): Liveborn infant male weighing 680 grams with Apgars of 6 and 8. Baby B (PPROM): Liveborn infant male weighing 570 grams with Apgars of 6 and 6.   SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY: Placenta  INDICATIONS: 25 y.o. para 0 at 24w0d admitted with dichorionic diamniotic twins due to premature preterm rupture of membranes of twin A at 21 weeks. She received a betamethasone course at 23w4d and was given antibiotics for latency. At 24w0d, she began having painful contractions. On sterile speculum exam, she was dilated to 4cm and she had milky discharge. She had a temperature of 37.9C with fetal tachycardia and therefore chorioamnionitis was suspected. She progressed to 6cm dilation and was therefore taken to the operating room for cesarean delivery.   DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfannenstiel incision.  A bladder flap was not created.  A classical incision was made in the uterus segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended superiorly with bandage scissors. The amniotic fluid surrounding the non-presenting twin was clear and ruptured with an Allis clamp. The previously described twin B was delivered first from the breech presentation and will now be called twin A.  The second twin (PPROM) was also delivered from breech presentation. The cords were doubly clamped and cut, and the babies were handed to the awaiting pediatricians. A sample of cord and cord blood were obtained for analysis.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.  The uterus was exteriorized, and the uterus was closed in 4 layers, first a running stitch of 0 Vicryl, then a running imbricating layer of 0 Vicryl. The 3rd layer was created using a series of horizontal mattress sutures of 0 Vicryl just under the serosal layer. The final layer was a baseball stitch using 2-0 Vicryl. The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity.  The fascia was closed with a suture of 0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated with saline.  The subcutaneous tissue was approximated with a running suture of 2-0 vicryl.  The skin was closed with a subcuticular stitch of 3-0 monocryl.  Dermabond was applied to the incision.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.  [**NAME**], MD
