Mother is very happy reporting bf going very well this time. Reports unsuccessful and difficulty w/breastfeeding first child--mother ended up pumping x 6 weeks and stopped d/t low milk supply.    Breasts pendulous soft symmetrical Nipples everted intact wide base  Encouraged bf on demand with unrestricted access to the breast with continued STS. Discussed infant feeding 8-10 times in 24 hours and normal cluster feeding behavior after the first 24 hours. Discouraged pacifiers, formula or artificial nipples due to the risk of low milk supply.
