This note was copied from the chart of BABY/[**NAME**]. Lactation note:  In to see dyad. Mother reports good bf overnight. C/o mildly sore nipples but only lasts < 10 seconds upon initial latch. Mother reported low milk supply with first child, so had  Several questions about pumping to increase supply and galactagogues.  I referred her to [**NAME**] for f/u. I also discussed pumping for engorgement s/s and after feeds to increase supply, however I cautioned oversupply issues. Mother and father very receptive to teaching.   Encouraged bf on demand with unrestricted access to the breast with continued STS. Discussed infant feeding 8-10 times in 24 hours and normal cluster feeding behavior after the first 24 hours. Discouraged pacifiers, formula or artificial nipples due to the risk of low milk supply. Left phone number, as infant had eaten before my arrival--to call me for next feed or for any problems, questions, or concerns.
