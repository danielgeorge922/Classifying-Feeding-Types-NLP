Date of Surgery: [**DATE**] PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  1) Intrauterine pregnancy at 39 weeks  2) Pre-eclampsia with severe features  3) Non-reassuring fetal heart tracing  POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  1) Intrauterine pregnancy at 39 weeks  2) Pre-eclampsia with severe features  3) Non-reassuring fetal heart tracing  4) Delivered  PROCEDURE:  1) Primary Low transverse cesarean section  SURGEON: [**NAME**]  ASSISTANT: [**NAME**]  ANESTHESIOLOGIST: [**NAME**] ANESTHESIA ASSISTANT: Chanowsky  ANESTHESIA: Epidural  EBL: 1000 mL  FLUID REPLACEMENT: 1500 mL  FINDINGS: Normal uterus, tubes and ovaries bilaterally. Liveborn infant male weighing 2972 grams with Apgars of 8 and 9.  SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY: None  INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 26yo P0020 who was admitted at 39 weeks gestation with severely elevated blood pressures indicative of pre-eclampsia with severe features. On arrival, she had a category 2 fetal heart tracing. She was admitted and started on magnesium therapy and prior to starting pitocin induction of labor, she began contracting every 4-5 minutes. She then began having deep variable decelerations that could not be resolved with intrauterine resuscitation and was therefore taken to the operating room for Stat cesarean delivery.  DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table. A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed. After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.  The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfanenstiel incision. The fascia was scored in the midline and extended with sharp dissection laterally. The underlying rectus muscle was dissected off the fascia with blunt dissection. The rectus muscles were separated in the midline with blunt dissection and the peritoneum was entered bluntly. A bladder flap was not created. A low transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with traction. The amniotic fluid was meconium stained. The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation with the assistance of a Kiwi vacuum. There were no pop offs. The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood were obtained for analysis. Cord blood for donation was collected. The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap. The uterus was exteriorized, and the uterine incision was closed in two layers, the first a running suture of 0 Monocryl and the second a running, imbricating suture of 0 Monocryl.  The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity. Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision and in the subfascial area. The fascia was closed with a single running suture of 0 Vicryl. The subcutaneous fat was closed with a running suture of 3-0 Vicryl. The skin was closed with a running subcuticular closure of 3-0 Monocryl. Dermabond was applied to the incision. The vagina was cleared of clots. All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.   [**NAME**], MD
