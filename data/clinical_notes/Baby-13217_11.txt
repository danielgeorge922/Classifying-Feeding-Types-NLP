CORD GASES: (Areterial)  Lab Results  Component Value Date   PHCORDA 7.27 [**DATE**]      (Venous):  Lab Results  Component Value Date   PHCORDV 7.33 [**DATE**]     SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY:  Segments from each tube  INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 31 y.o. female P2113, with history of prior cesarean x2, history of uterine window noted during last cesarean, and suspected fetal mesenteric cyst who presented at 37w0d for her scheduled repeat cesarean and BTI, as she desired no future fertility. After placement of spinal anesthesia, fetal bradycardia to the 60s was noted. Decision was made to proceed with emergent cesarean delivery.   DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt. Fetal bradycardia was noted. An emergent cesarean section was called. Her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through prior Pfanenstiel incision.  The incision was taken down to the level of the fascia which was incised in the midline with scalpel. The incision was extended laterally in either direction over the rectus muscles.  The rectus muscle was divided sharply with a scalpel. The peritoneum was entered bluntly.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with the surgeon's fingers.  The amniotic fluid was clear upon rupture.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood was obtained for analysis.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.  The uterus was exteriorized, and the uterine incision was closed in  a running suture of 0 Vicryl. Additional sutures of 0 Vicryl were placed along hysterotomy for additional hemostasis.   The right fallopian tube was identified to its fimbriated end and a defect was made in a relatively avascular portion of the mesosalpinx underlying the mid isthmic portion of the tube.  A segment of the mid isthmic portion of the tube was ligated with two sutures of 0 Chromic suture and the intervening portion of the tube excised and handed off the field; adequate hemostasis was assured.  The exact same procedure was performed on the opposite side after identifying that tube to its fimbriated end; again, adequate hemostasis was assured.  The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity.  Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision, posterior to the bladder, and in the subfascial area.  The fascia was closed with one suture of 0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and closed with running suture of 3-0 vicryl.  The skin was closed with a running subcuticular closure of 3-0 Monocryl.  Dermabond was applied to the incision.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.  Dictated for Dr. [**NAME**], MD
