Lactation note Mom was eating breakfast and the baby was just returning from a frenotomy procedure when I introduced myself and my role to her. The baby remained asleep while I provided mom with lactation education. I reviewed basic details including the practice of breast massage, hand expression, STS, good body alignment with positioning the baby to get a deep latch and demand unrestricted feedings. Mom reported her understanding of each item I introduced. She reports having sore nipples and has nipple cream available. I instructed her about applying breast milk prior to the nipple cream for improved healing and comfort. Mom verbalized her desire to complete her meal while the baby was asleep so I encouraged her to call for lactation assistance when needed. Plan Assist with positioning and latch as requested. Support mom's breastfeeding goals. Reinforce the risk of diminished milk supply related to supplementing with formula and the use of pacifiers and artificial nipples.  [**NAME**] RN, BSN, IBCLC
