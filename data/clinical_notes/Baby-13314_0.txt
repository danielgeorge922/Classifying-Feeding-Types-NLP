Received pt via wheelchair, 38 weeks and 4 days with c/o LOF and contractions. Patient denies bleeding and repots + FM. Patient was seen in triage last night and was sent home. Started noticing LOF at 2300 and didn't know it was her BOW. She continued to leak fluids and decided to present to labor and delivery. Family at bedside for support. Applied EFm x2.
