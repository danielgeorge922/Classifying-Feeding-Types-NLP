We have lost IV access for the pt with irritation and bruising to the site. Ice has been applied. Stat nurse was paged but could not come at this time. Anesthesia was then called and the MD attempted but could not get an IV because the pt was dehydrated. High risk OB personnel paged to inform of loss of access. Pt meds are due. Will continue to monitor and awaiting call back from high risk OB.
