Lactation note Mom was awake and eating breakfast when I rounded this morning. The FOB was also present and very engaged in the lactation education and instructions asking questions and washing pump parts. Assessment Mrs [**NAME**] was attentive to instructions about the pump use including preemie setting, suction control, proper flange fit for comfort and effectiveness and cleaning. She reports pumping at 0700 on the standard setting because she did not know about the preemie setting. Intervention  I provided a pumping care plan and pumping log and demonstrated how to use it to track her daily pumping progress and milk production increases. I demonstrated how to initiate the preemie setting, disassemble and reassemble her individual pump pieces for cleaning and use. I instructed her to remove her pumping pieces for use after d/c while visiting the baby in the NICU. Lanolin nipple cream was provided as requested and the use of mothers colostrum and milk for healing and lanolin for comfort was explained and encouraged. I was unable to assess the pt's breasts but she denies any pain or damage at this time. Plan Continue to provide lactation support as lactogenesis II ensues.  Ongoing assessment for prevention of engorgement and plugged ducts.  Reinforce the need for frequent pumping, breast massage and hand expression.  Assess for changing needs of flange size to maintain proper fit and prevent nipple damage while pumping. Please contact the lactation team as needed after d/c.
