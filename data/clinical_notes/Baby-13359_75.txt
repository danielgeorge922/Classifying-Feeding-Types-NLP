Date of Surgery: [**DATE**]  PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  1) Intrauterine pregnancy at 33 weeks 2) Pre-eclampsia 3) Fetal intrauterine growth restriction 4) Oligohydramnios 5) Non-reassuring fetal heart tracing  POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  1) Intrauterine pregnancy at 33 weeks 2) Pre-eclampsia 3) Fetal intrauterine growth restriction 4) Oligohydramnios 5) Non-reassuring fetal heart tracing 6) Suspected placental abruption  PROCEDURE:  1) Primary low transverse cesarean section  SURGEON: [**NAME**] ASSISTANTS: [**NAME**]  ANESTHESIOLOGIST: [**NAME**] ANESTHESIA ASSISTANT: [**NAME**]  ANESTHESIA: Spinal  EBL: 800 mL  FLUID REPLACEMENT: 1500 mL  FINDINGS: Normal uterus, tubes and ovaries bilaterally. Liveborn infant female weighing 2438 grams with Apgars of 8 and 9. Very scant clear amniotic fluid. Placenta appeared to have approximately 20% abruption along the margin.   SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY: Placenta  INDICATIONS: 29 y.o. para 0111 at 33w5d admitted with pre-eclampsia, oligohydramnios and intrauterine growth restriction. On daily nonstress test, she was found to have repetitive prolonged variable and late decelerations not responsive to intrauterine resuscitation and was therefore taken to the operating room for cesarean delivery.   DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfannenstiel incision.  A bladder flap was not created.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with tractiong.  The amniotic fluid was very scant but clear.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut, and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatricians. A sample of cord and cord blood were obtained for analysis.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.  The uterus was exteriorized, and closed in 2 layers, the first a running suture of 0 Vicryl and the second a running, imbricating suture of 0 Vicryl.  The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity.  The fascia was closed with a suture of 0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated with saline.  The subcutaneous tissue was approximated with a running suture of 3-0 vicryl.  The skin was closed with a subcuticular stitch of 3-0 monocryl.  Dermabond was applied to the incision.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.   [**NAME**], MD
