Assessment: Pt feels breastfeeding is going very well.  Expresses concern re: infant wanting to eat frequently - concerned infant is getting enough to eat.  Infant is currently nursing on left breast in cradle position with shallow latch.  Breasts are soft, round.  Nipples are everted and pink on tips, but intact.  Pt states she is aware of how to hand express her breasts, and colostrum noted bilaterally. Infant had a frenotomy performed yesterday and is able to extend tongue past gums on visual exam. Supportive fob at bedside.  Intervention: Assisted pt to reposition infant and latch in cross cradle hold on right breast with deep, asymmetrical latch and active suck/ audible swallow.  Pt reports much less discomfort with deeper latch.  Discussed importance of asymmetrical, chin-led latch, as well as allowing infant to determine feeding times by observing infant for feeding cues. Encouraged to choose a position that provides upper back support and guidance.  Instructed to allow infant to finish on one breast, using breast compressions to maximize feeding time before switching to second breast at each feeding.  Reviewed nipple care, typical cluster feeding behavior, infant stomach capacity and expected output for infant.  Also discussed managing possible milk oversupply during milk onset. Discouraged use of pacifiers or artificial nipples until breastfeeding is well-established, around 3-4 weeks of age. Encouraged maximizing skin to skin time with infant over the next several days as well.  Pt provided with a copy of the [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] Breastfeeding book and made aware of resources available to her after discharge.  Pt plans to return to work after 12 weeks. Has already obtained a pump and reviewed recommended milk storage guidelines. Invited to support group.   Plan: Will continue to support pt's breastfeeding goals. Encouraged her to call for assistance as needed, and left contact information. Pt verbalized understanding.
