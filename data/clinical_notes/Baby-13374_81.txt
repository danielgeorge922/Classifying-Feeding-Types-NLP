Lactation F/U note The baby was crying when I entered her room and mom reports the baby is fussy, trying to poop and trying to nurse all at the same time. She denies any breastfeeding complications or questions at this time and agrees to call if lactation assistance is needed. She declined my offer to help her with burping or repositioning the baby as her visitor is present and assisting her with baby care.  [**NAME**] RN, BSN, IBCLC
