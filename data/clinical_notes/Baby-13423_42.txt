Assessment: Pt called for latch observation - pt had already nursed infant for 5 minutes with audible swallowing on right breast before lactation entered room.  Breasts are full/firm, well developed.  Nipples are everted, pink but intact.  Pt is aware of how to hand express her breasts, and streams of colostrum noted bilaterally.   Intervention: Assisted pt to unwrap infant and attempt to latch infant in clutch hold on right breast - infant not interested at this time.  Burped infant, has hiccups, no feeding cues at this time. Reassured pt with her large colostrum supply, it was possible infant is done feeding after 5 minutes of active sucking/swallowing.  Discussed importance of asymmetrical, chin-led latch, as well as allowing infant to determine feeding times by observing infant for feeding cues.  Instructed to allow infant to finish on one breast, using breast compressions to maximize feeding time before switching to second breast at each feeding.  Reviewed nipple care, typical cluster feeding behavior, infant stomach capacity and expected output for infant.  Also discussed managing possible milk oversupply during milk onset. Discouraged use of pacifiers or artificial nipples until breastfeeding is well-established, around 3-4 weeks of age. Encouraged maximizing skin to skin time with infant over the next several days as well.  Pt provided with a copy of the [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] Breastfeeding book and made aware of resources available to her after discharge.  Pt plans to return to work after 8 weeks, at which time she plans to wean infant - works at prison, and she feels pumping is not possible there.  Reviewed recommended milk storage guidelines.   Plan: Encouraged pt to call at next feeding for assistance/observation - Will continue to support pt's breastfeeding goals. Encouraged her to call for assistance as needed, and left contact information. Pt verbalized understanding.
