[**NAME**] has 35.3 week twin boys and her desire is to breast feed. She reports that in L&D they breast feed and she was also able to hand express colostrum and syringe feed them about .5ml to 1 ml. She last fed them at 1200. Blood sugars are stable. I assessed her breasts and both nipples/areolas are very edematous. After massage and back pressure the tissue loosened a little. Both boys are sleepy. We attempted to waken the babies for latching but unsuccessfully. Hand expression yielded some drops of colostrum but not enough to put in a spoon or syringe. I provided a pump showing her the parts for assembly and disassembly. I instructed her to pump regularly 8-10 times in 24 hours and explained that this is for stimulation only and not to focus on production. I provided her medicine cups and syringes for formula supplementation with 22 cal Enfacare per [**NAME**] ARNP.  [**NAME**] CLC LRN
