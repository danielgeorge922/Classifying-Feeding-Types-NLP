Pt asked if she is ready to get up out of bed at this time. Pt reports she does not want to get up because of her foley, general discomfort and she wants to rest at this time. Pt educated on the importance of geting up and moving for healing. Pt reports she still does not want to get up. Encouraged pt to call this RN if she changed her mind or needed any additional assistance. Will continue to monitor.
