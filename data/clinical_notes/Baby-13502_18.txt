Date of Surgery: [**DATE**]  PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  1) Intrauterine pregnancy at 39 weeks 2) Prior cesarean x 1 3) Fetal transposition of the great arteries  POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  1) Intrauterine pregnancy at 39 weeks 2) Prior cesarean x 1 3) Fetal transposition of the great arteries  PROCEDURE:  1) Repeat low transverse cesarean section  SURGEON: Oguneleye ASSISTANTS: [**NAME**]  ANESTHESIOLOGIST: [**NAME**] ANESTHESIA ASSISTANT: [**NAME**]  ANESTHESIA: Spinal  EBL: 1000 mL  FLUID REPLACEMENT: 1500 mL  FINDINGS: Severe pelvic adhesive disease between the anterior body of the uterus and the anterior abdominal wall. Severe adhesions also between the lower uterine segment to the bladder. Thick band of adhesion at the uterine fundus that precluded exteriorization. Normal uterus, tubes and ovaries bilaterally.  Liveborn infant male weighing 3864 grams with Apgars of 7 and 9.  SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY: None  INDICATIONS: 26 y.o. para 1001 at 39w1d admitted for scheduled repeat cesarean delivery. This pregnancy is complicated by fetal transposition of the great arteries. She has had a prior cesarean delivery and declines trial of labor.   DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfannenstiel incision. Severe adhesive disease was encountered. A bladder flap was not created.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with traction.  The amniotic fluid was clear.  The left rectus muscle was cut with bandage scissors to allow for delivery of the fetal head. The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut, and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatricians. A sample of cord and cord blood were obtained for analysis.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.  The uterus was NOT exteriorized due to severe adhesions. The corner of the uterine incision was closed with a figure of 8 with 0-monocryl and the uterus was closed in 2 layers, the first a running suture of 0 monocryl and the second a running suture of 0 monocryl. The uterine incision was examined closely and was hemostatic.  The fascia was closed with a suture of 0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated with saline.  The subcutaneous tissue was approximated with interrupted sutures of 3-0 chormic.  The skin was closed with a subcuticular stitch of 4-0 monocryl.  Dermabond was applied to the incision.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.  [**NAME**], MD
