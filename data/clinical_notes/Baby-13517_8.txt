Attending note.  I met with the patient and her partner together with Drs. Egerman from MFM, Dr. [**NAME**] from neonatology, and Dr. [**NAME**] to discuss a plan of care.  Briefly, Ms. [**NAME**] is a 27 yo P2002 at 25 4/7 wks who has been followed by HROB and peds cardiology since approximately 20 weeks gestation at which time she was diagnosed with fetal non-immune hydrops.  Infectious disease workup and fetal ECHO did not reveal underlying etiology.  Pregnancy o/w complicated by CHTN on aldomet and procardia.  She presented today for follow-up outpatient fetal ECHO which showed significantly worsening fetal hydrops.  She was then directly admitted for fetal monitoring and a betamethasone course and evaluation of elevated BPs with concern for possible mirror syndrome.    On admission, initial BPs noted to be 130's-170's/90's-110's.  No s/s preE.  Pt had not taken her anti-HTN meds today, and was given labetalol 20mg IV x 1 dose with subsequent BPs noted to be 120-130's/80-90's.  PreE panel shows nl plts,LFTs and Cr.  Pr/Cr ratio = 361.  Pt is currently receiving magnesium sulfate for sz prophylaxis and has received her 1st dose of betamethasone at 1640.  FHT currently shows decreased variability with repetitive variable decelerations.  Together we again discussed the poor fetal prognosis with likely in-utero fetal demise if the pregnancy continues.  The patient is also aware that there is low chance of fetal survival with delivery at this GA.  The chance of survival cannot be well-predicted without knowing how much functional lung tissue is present.  The patient was offered comfort measures for the baby if the baby is delivered and the neonatologists feel that invasive intervention would be futile.  The patient requests full intervention for the baby if delivery is recommended at this time.  In making a decision for delivery to try to maximize fetal survival, the decision is based on whether or not we can try to get a full course of betamethasone administered prior to complete fetal deterioration vs. whether or not delaying delivery would lead to a stat C/S under GA in the setting of fetal bradycardia which would likely further diminish chances of fetal survival in this already compromised baby.  We have discussed with the patient that our recommendation is to proceed with cesarean delivery now due to FHR concerns.  I also again addressed the patient's previous desire to have permanent sterilization.  We again discussed the risk of regret, and the patient has decided to opt for a non-permanent method of birth control until she can give further consideration to permanent sterilization.  Currently preparing to transfer pt to OR for C/S.  Anesthesia aware.  [**NAME**], MD Assistant Professor Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**]
