Lactation : Mom states that her nipples are sore. She breast feed her 2 year old for 13 months. Mom was breastfeeding the baby in a cradle hold ; the baby had a shallow latch and she was not aligned correctly.  Breast and Feeding Assessment:  Mom has round symmetric breast with everted, red intact nipples. Her nipples appear pinched when the baby came off the breast. I assisted mom with latching the baby onto the breast in a cross-cradle hold ; mom was instructed to have the baby's body facing her body. Mom states that the latch did not hurt as much. The baby did have a nutritive suck. I assessed the baby's tongue and I was able to feel a posterior tight frenulum .   M.D. [**NAME**] made aware of the need to have the tongue re- evaluated.   M.D.Knickerbocker evaluated the tongue and he did the frenotomy .   Intervention: support mom's breastfeeding goals and assist as needed. I gave her lanolin with instructions mom encouraged to call for lactation help as needed.
