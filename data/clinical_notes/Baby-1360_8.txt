I met with the patient and her husband in preop holding.  We confirmed the indications for repeat cesarean section and reviewed the patient's preferences regarding blood products.  She will accept FFP and blood collected from the cell saver system but refuses refuses donated blood.  She specifically states she would rather die than receive donated blood.  She is aware of the possible need for a hysterectomy should she have uncontrollable bleeding.  The patient requests bilateral tubal interruption.  She is aware BTI is permanent but not guaranteed with an ~ 1% failure rate.  She is aware of alternative contraceptive methods.    Patient understands and wishes to proceed with procedure.  Anesthesia is aware of the patient and her desires regarding blood products.  The cell saver technician has been notified and is on the way to L&D.  I have asked for a Ligasure unit and Impact device to be brought to L&D.
