Liveborn infant female weighing 3466 grams with Apgars of 3 and 8. Bladder adhered high on the lower uterine segment. No other significant adhesions encountered.   SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY: placenta  INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 34 y.o. female now P2002 s/p repeat cesarean section for NRFHT, arrest of descent and chorioamnionitis.  DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfannenstiel incision.  A bladder flap was created.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with cephalo-caudal traction.  The amniotic fluid was meconium stained.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood were obtained for analysis.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.  The uterus was exteriorized, and the uterine incision was closed in two layers: the first layer was 2 running sutures of 0 Vicryl and the second layer a partial imbricating suture of 2-0 Vicryl.    The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity.  Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision and in the subfascial area.  The fascia was closed with a single running suture of 0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissue was closed with interrupted sutures of 0-chromic. The skin was closed with a running subcuticular closure of 3-0 Monocryl.  Dermabond was applied to the incision.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.     [**NAME**], MD  Attending Note: I was present for the entire procedure.
