This note was copied from the chart of BABY/[**NAME**]. Lactation note:  In to see family. Mother holding infant, sleeping. Mother reports frenotomy completed and bf once right after. Reports continued painful latch, but "better suck." after frenotomy.    Gave extensive education to mother regarding cluster feeding tonight, community resources including [**NAME**] and support group. Educated on diaper and feeds diary to ensure adequate intake. Discussed alternative feeding devices and EBM if unable to latch. Discussed tongue exercises post frenotomy d/t posterior tongue tie to possibly assist with strenghtening tongue and helping to prevent scar tissue or re-anastomosis.  Discussed s/s engorgement and relief methods including hot compress/shower, massage, frequent feeding/pumping to comfort, NSAIDS, and ice packs.  Encouraged bf on demand with unrestricted access to the breast with continued STS. Discussed infant feeding 8-10 times in 24 hours. Discouraged pacifiers, formula or artificial nipples due to the risk of low milk supply. Left phone number, as infant had eaten before my arrival--to call me for next feed or for any problems, questions, or concerns but mother likely being d/c'd soon.
