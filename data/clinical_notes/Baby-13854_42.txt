Pt complaining of her nipples being sore and wanting a breast pump; pt nipples are reddened. I offered to give pt a nipple shield just for protection of her nipples; pt at this time didn't want. She just wants to try and pump to feed baby; I informed pt that the pump probably would hurt worst than her baby; she states she understands but still wants the pump. Will inform Lactation and get her started with pumping; will continue to monitor.
