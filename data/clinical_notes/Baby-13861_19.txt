Assessment: Pt feels infant has been breastfeeding almost constantly since she arrived to unit.  She is sitting in chair with infant in cradle hold on right breast, latched to tip of nipple.  Breasts are soft, pendulous, symmetrical.  Nipples are everted and intact, right nipple appears pinched where infant was latched to tip.  Pt was taught how to hand express her breasts, and colostrum noted bilaterally.   Intervention: Assisted pt to latch infant in modified cross cradle hold on right breast with deep latch and rhythmic suck.  Pt reports no discomfort with latch.  Discussed importance of asymmetrical, chin-led latch, as well as allowing infant to determine feeding times by observing infant for feeding cues.  Instructed to allow infant to finish on one breast, using breast compressions to maximize feeding time before switching to second breast at each feeding.  Reviewed nipple care, typical cluster feeding behavior, infant stomach capacity and expected output for infant.  Also discussed managing possible milk oversupply during milk onset. Discouraged use of pacifiers or artificial nipples until breastfeeding is well-established, around 3-4 weeks of age. Encouraged maximizing skin to skin time with infant over the next several days as well.  During visit infant unlatched and was sleeping, assisted her to burp and switch to left breast, infant latched deeply.   Pt provided with a copy of the [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] Breastfeeding book and made aware of resources available to her after discharge.  Pt plans to breastfeed for two months and then switch to formula.  States she does not want to pump.  Plan: Will continue to support pt's breastfeeding goals. Encouraged her to call for assistance as needed, and left contact information. Pt verbalized understanding.
