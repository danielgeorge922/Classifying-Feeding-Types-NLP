Pt reports that she has been pumping but hasn't recently because she was in pain and spilled her colostrum on herself which was very frustrating to her. Pt has abrasion to left areola. Per pt the baby hasn't be able to try to nurse and that is from rubbing from the breastpump. Pt was medicated for pain and encouraged to pump again soon but to call RN to ensure that there is no more rubbing to prevent further damage. Advised MOB to hand express colostrum on the area to promote healing. Pt will call for help when ready. Will continue to monitor.
