Assisted pt to get infant latched.  Attempted football hold, S2S, and cross cradle.  Infant was not interested and had 2 stretches overnight without being fed.  After allowing pt and infant to be S2S for about 5 minutes, notice infant was trying to latch onto center of patient's chest.  Re-attempted cross cradle latch and was successful.  Assisted mother to latch infant, infant developed 1:1 suck/swallow ratio. Pt happy to see that infant is eating and still continues 15 minutes after developing good latch.  Will recommend that lactation see patient for continued assistance today.  Will ctm.
