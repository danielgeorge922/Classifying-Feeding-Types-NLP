ROUTINE EEG  Date: [**DATE**]- [**DATE**]  Reason for EEG:  Spells concerning for seizure  History: 31 y.o. right-handed  female, currently 34 weeks pregnant, with a previous history of fibromyalgia, bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, substance abuse (alcohol, opiates, currently on methadone), chronic pain, and some report of seizure (not on seizure meds) without further information, who was found down at home, unresponsive and seen to be shaking by husband or EMS.  Technical summary:  This long term EEG was performed utilizing the 21-channel digital system.    Report:   Posterior basic rhythm was not identified.  Spontaneous variability was present.Reactivity was present.  Beta activity of low amplitude was present at  10-20  hz, bilaterally.  Theta activity of low amplitude is present, at  3-5  hz,  bilaterally.   Drowsiness:  Intermittent bilateral slowing was noted suggestive of drowsy periods.  Occasional bursts of bilateral beta activity was noted which could represent poorly formed spindles.   Abnormal activity Continuous delta activity was present bilaterally, at times quasi-rhythmic, sharply contoured in morphology,  maximal on the right, over the  parietal-occipital head regions.  Intermittent sharp waves/ spikes, at times occurring in short runs lasting 4-5 seconds, at 1 hz,  were noted over the central-parieto-occipital regions, bilaterally and incependently on both right and left, maximal on the right  Intermittently the slow waves organised into rhythmic periodic discharges, seen bilaterally when the patient was being cared for by providers, suggesting the possibility of stimulation induced rhythmic periodic discharges (SIRPIDS)   Clinical interpretation:   This is a moderately abnormal EEG because:  - continuous delta slowing noted bilaterally , maximal over the right posterior quadrants.  - Intermittent sharp waves sometimes in short runs, noted over the central-parieto-occipital regions, bilaterally and independently on both right and left, maximal on the right.   - periods of SIRPIDS, when the patient was being cared for by providers.  - Absence of normal physiological rythms.   The EEG is suggestive of a diffuse cerebral disturbance with epileptogenicisty noted over the central-parieto-occipital regions on both sides.  Also intermittent SIRPIDS were noted which could suggest an epiletogenic potential.  SIRPIDS are usually noted when there is a change in the neurological status.
