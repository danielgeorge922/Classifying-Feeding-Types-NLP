Pt called out for assistance with infant feeding and latch.  Infant became very fussy/agitated when offered bare breast in right clutch position.  Parents excellent at calming infant, very patient. Infant calms readily with offered gloved finger, able to suck, able to latch right after and nurse briefly with audible swallowing. Attempt to re-latch resulted in more agitation, suggested and pt was able to hand express several mls of colostrum and offer to infant via spoon, calmed and then attempt to re-latch.   Infant noted to elevate tongue to roof of mouth most of the time, only briefly dropping tongue while attempting latch, making latching very difficult.  Continued to attempt for approximately 10 minutes, then pt applied nipple shield and latched infant well. Audible swallowing and milk in shield confirmed transfer.   Suggested pumping after feeds involving nipple shield and offering EBM via cup/spoon prior to feeds to assist with calming infant. Also encouraged to keep STS and offer breast at earliest signs of hunger, rather than delaying feed with diaper change, etc. Encouraged to offer  Bare breast first and use shield only if needed.  Provided with [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] breastfeeding book and reviewed resources available after discharge, including suggesting they follow up with M Ryngaert or T Glaser as soon as able to assist to assist with transitioning from use of nipple shield. Parents stated understanding.
