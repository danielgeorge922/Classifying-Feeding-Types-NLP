Visited mom to see how breast feeding was going. On entry to room baby was sleeping but mom was about to give bottle feed. Discussed with mom risks to breast milk supply if formula  and artificial nipples are given to baby. Mom said she had fed her other babies with both breast and bottle. Offered to help mom to put baby to breast. Baby very sleepy. Left contact number with mom and encouraged to call if she would like more assistance with breast feeding.
