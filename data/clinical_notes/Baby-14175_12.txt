Counseled patient on estimated EFW of 4200g extrapolated from a 40 wk sono at 4065g (86%). She does not have diabetes. Discussed with her that at this EFW some providers would offer her a primary cesarean section to decrease the risk of shoulder dystocia and overall maternal and fetal/neonatal morbidity/mortaliity. we would not offer a primary cesarean section and proceed with vaginal delivery. She does understand the limitations of third trimester ultrasound. Discussed with her the possibility of shoulder dystocia at this EFW and any EFW really as shoulder dystocias cannot be predicted (although there are risk factors) and 50% of shoulder dystocias occur in the setting of a baby < 4000g. Specifically, discussed the maneuvers we perform to reduce a shoulder dystocia and the complications of a shoulder dystocia including but not limited to fetal clavicle/humerus fracture, fetal hypoxia, maternal laceration, and fetal death. Also, discussed with patient that we will have a low threshold for cesarean section in the setting of an abnormal labor curve, avoidance of operative vaginal delivery, and preparation for maternal postpartum hemorrhage. Patient voices understanding of shoulder dystocia and its complications and agrees with plan to proceed with vaginal delivery.   [**NAME**], MD
