Obstetrics Operative Report   Name: [**NAME**]  Date of Surgery: [**DATE**]  PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  1) Singleton intrauterine pregnancy at 39 weeks 2) Hepatitis C infection  POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Same, plus delivered  PROCEDURE:  1) Primary low transverse cesarean section  SURGEON: [**NAME**], MD ASSISTANT: [**NAME**], MD  ANESTHESIOLOGIST: [**NAME**], MD ANESTHESIA ASSISTANT: [**NAME**], MD  ANESTHESIA: Spinal  EBL: 800 mL  FLUID REPLACEMENT: 300 mL  FINDINGS: Normal uterus, tubes and ovaries bilaterally.  Liveborn infant male weighing 3240 grams with Apgars of 8 and 9.  SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY:  Placenta  INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 23 y.o. female para 0 at 39w1d with hepatitis C infection with viral load greater than 7 million. Given increased risk for vertical transmission in the event of vaginal delivery, the patient was scheduled for primary cesarean delivery.  DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table. A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed. After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfannenstiel incision. The incision was taken down to the level of the fascia which was incised in the midline. The incision was extended laterally in either direction over the rectus muscles. The fascia was dissected off the rectus muscle superiorly and then inferiorly. The rectus muscle was divided bluntly. The peritoneum was entered in a clear space sharply.  A bladder flap was created. A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with blunt dissection.  The amniotic fluid was clear. The above described infant was delivered from the cephalic presentation. The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood was obtained for analysis. The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.  The uterus was exteriorized, and the uterine incision was closed in two layers, the first a running suture of 0Vicryl and the second a running, imbricating suture of 0 Vicryl.    The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity. Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision, posterior to the bladder, and in the subfascial area. The fascia was closed with a running suture of 0 Vicryl. The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and re-approximated with interrupted sutures of 3-0 Vicryl. The skin was closed with a running subcuticular closure of 4-0 Monocryl. Dermabond was applied to the incision. The vagina was cleared of clots. All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.   [**NAME**], M.D.
