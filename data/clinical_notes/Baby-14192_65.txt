Date of Surgery: [**DATE**]  PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  1) Intrauterine pregnancy at 39 weeks 2) Gestational diabetes mellitus, diet controlled 3) Advanced maternal age 4) Undesired fertility 5) Morbid obesity 6) Non reassuring fetal heart tracing  POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Same + delivered  PROCEDURE:  1) Primary low transverse cesarean section 2) O'Leary uterine artery ligation 3) Parkland Bilateral Tubal interruption  SURGEON: [**NAME**] ASSISTANTS: [**NAME**]  ANESTHESIOLOGIST: [**NAME**] ANESTHESIA ASSISTANT: Cavanaugh  ANESTHESIA: Epidural  EBL: 1000 mL  FLUID REPLACEMENT: 1200 mL  FINDINGS: Normal uterus, tubes and ovaries bilaterally. Extension involving the R uterine artery, hemostatic after O'leary. Liveborn infant female weighing 3136 grams with Apgars of 9 and 9.  SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY: Bilateral portion of tubes  INDICATIONS: 43 y.o. para 1011 at 39w0d admitted for induction of labor due to advanced maternal age, gestational diabetes and decreased fetal movement. She progressed in labor to completely dilated but began having repetitive deep variable decelerations with the second stage refractory to intrauterine resuscitation. Therefore, she was taken to the operating room for cesarean delivery. She had previously requested bilateral tubal interruption for sterilization.   DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfannenstiel incision.  A bladder flap was not created.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with traction.  The amniotic fluid was clear.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut, and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatricians. A sample of cord and cord blood were obtained for analysis.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.    The uterus was exteriorized, and the uterus was closed in a single layers of a running suture of 0 Vicryl. Additional hemostasis was achieved with figure of eight sutures of 0 Vicryl. The right corner of the hysterotomy was bleeding briskly and appeared to involve the uterine artery. An O'leary stitch was then performed with a 0 Vicryl in order to achieve hemostasis.    The right fallopian tube was identified to its fimbriated end and a defect was made in a relatively avascular portion of the mesosalpinx underlying the mid isthmic portion of the tube.  A segment of the mid isthmic portion of the tube was ligated with two sutures of 0 Chromic suture and the intervening portion of the tube excised and handed off the field; adequate hemostasis was assured.  The exact same procedure was performed on the opposite side after identifying that tube to its fimbriated end; again, adequate hemostasis was assured.  The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity and the hysterotomy was hemostatic.  The fascia was closed with a suture of 0 Vicryl, beginning at each end and meeting in the midline.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated with saline.  The subcutaneous tissue was approximated with interrupted a running suture of 3-0 vicryl.  The skin was closed with a subcuticular stitch of 3-0 monocryl.  Dermabond was applied to the incision and it was covered with a Bioguard bandage.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.  [**NAME**], MD
