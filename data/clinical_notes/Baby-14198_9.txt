DEPARTMENT OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY Operative Note  Date of Surgery: [**DATE**]  Preoperative Diagnosis: Intrauterine Pregnancy at 37w3d, Prior Cesarean x1 with Unknown Scar, History of Stillborn, History of LSO/Laparotomy for Endometriosis, History of Ureteral Injury  Postoperative Diagnosis: Same, Plus Delivered  Operation Performed: Repeat Low Transverse Cesarean Section  Surgeon: [**NAME**]  Assisstant: [**NAME**]  Anesthesiologist: [**NAME**]  Anesthesiology Assisstant: Audd  Anesthesia: Spinal  Pathology: Placenta  EBL: 1500ml  Findings: Normal uterus, tubes bilaterally.  Normal right ovary.  Left ovary surgically absent.  Liveborn infant male weighing 2942 grams with Apgars of 7 and 9.  Moderate adhesions at the level of the rectus abdominus muscles.  Uterus initially boggy after delivery of fetus accounting for elevated EBL.  Indication: [**NAME**] is a 33 y.o. female para 1111 at 37w3d who presented for scheduled repeat cesarean.  She had a history of cesarean at 32 weeks with unknown scar.  That pregnancy resulted in stillbirth.  She also had history of laparotomy for endometriosis that resulted in a left ureteral transection that required stents. Cesarean delivery was recommended due to history of unknown prior cesarean scar.  She received 1 unit of packed red blood cells prior to the case due to post-op anemia (Hgb 6.8).  Procedure: After satisfactory anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped in a routine fashion for abdominal surgery. Time-out confirmed patient and procedure. The abdomen was entered with a Pfannensteil approach.  The superior aspect of the fascial incision was grasped upward and the underlying rectus muscle was dissected away with a combination of sharp and blunt dissection.  Attention was then turned to the inferior aspect which was grasped upward and underlying rectus muscles were dissected away with sharp dissection.  The rectus muscles were separated in the midline and the peritoneum was entered with sharp dissection while maintaining visualization of the bowel and bladder.  A bladder flap was created with Metzenbaum scissors.  A low transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and extended laterally.  Amniotic fluid was clear. The above described infant was delivered from the cephalic presentation. Nuchal cord x 2 was reduced after delivery of fetus.  The cord was clamped and the cord was cut and the baby handed to the pediatrician who was present for delivery. Blood for gases and DNA was obtained. The placenta was delivered with cord traction.   The uterus was cleared of clots and debris. The uterus was exteriorized. The uterus was closed with a two layer closure; initial layer was a 0-vicryl locking layer; the second layer was an imbricating layer of 0-vicryl.  The abdominal cavity posterior to the uterus was wiped with a moist lap.  The uterus was replaced into the patient's abdomen. The hysterotomy was hemostatic as was the fascia and rectus muscles. The abdominal gutters were wiped with a moist lap.  Urine was noted to be clear throughout procedure.  The fascia was closed with 0-Vicryl starting at the angle and running in a continuous fashion. The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated with normal saline and was found to be hemostatic. The subcutaneous tissue was reapproximated with 2-0 vicryl.  The skin was closed with with 0-monocryl. Dermabond was applied. The vagina was cleared of clots. All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.
