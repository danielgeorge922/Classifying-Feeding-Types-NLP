Pt stated she felt that she was starting to get engorged. Pt about to take a shower. Instructed pt that the warm shower would help with her "let down." Pt verbalized understanding. Suggested to pt that due to that pattern of her stating her breasts were starting to get full and how often she expressed that I would suggest trying to pump or hand express 3-4 hours after the next time she pumps once she gets out of the shower. Pt verbalized understanding and agreed. Will continue to monitor and assist pt with breastfeeding and pumping.
