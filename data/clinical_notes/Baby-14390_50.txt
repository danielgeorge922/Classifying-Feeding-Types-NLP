Assessment: Pt feels breastfeeding is going well.  Expresses concern re: infant cluster feeding overnight.  Infant is currently swaddled and asleep in mother's arms.  Breasts are soft, round.  Nipples are everted and intact.  Pt states she is aware of how to hand express her breasts, and colostrum noted bilaterally. Denies pain with feeding. Infant noted to be at 99% of birth weight, and gained 17 grams in last 24 hours.  Intervention:  Reassured that cluster feeding is normal and will most likely occur again tonight. Discussed importance of asymmetrical, chin-led latch, as well as allowing infant to determine feeding times by observing infant for feeding cues.  Instructed to allow infant to finish on one breast, using breast compressions to maximize feeding time before switching to second breast at each feeding.  Reviewed nipple care, typical cluster feeding behavior, infant stomach capacity and expected output for infant.  Also discussed managing possible milk oversupply during milk onset. Discouraged use of pacifiers or artificial nipples until breastfeeding is well-established, around 3-4 weeks of age. Encouraged maximizing skin to skin time with infant over the next several days as well.  Pt provided with a copy of the [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] Breastfeeding book and made aware of resources available to her after discharge.   Plan: Will continue to support pt's breastfeeding goals. Encouraged her to call for assistance as needed, and left contact information. Pt verbalized understanding.
