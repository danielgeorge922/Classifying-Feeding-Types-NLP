Was surrogate last year but did not pump her milk, but it did come in. C/o infant not opening mouth very wide to latch. Was tx from ocala and was given opioids. Mother and infant both very sleepy. S/p SVD.   Breasts soft symmetrical Nipples everted short intact. Easily able to hand express colostrum Infant oral assessment: very short anterior frenum. Unable to assess much else, as infant asleep and suck reflex depressed. Not showing feeding cues.   Encouraged bf on demand with unrestricted access to the breast with continued STS. Discussed infant feeding 8-10 times in 24 hours and normal cluster feeding behavior after the first 24 hours. Discouraged pacifiers, formula or artificial nipples due to the risk of low milk supply. Left phone number, as infant had eaten before my arrival--to call me for next feed or for any problems, questions, or concerns.   At this time, recommend mother feed t/o noc. Gave size 24 nipple shield and explained use just in case. Will have Lactation f/u tomorrow. Likely infant will need frentomy, but infant may be able to latch and transfer milk without intervention. Mother agreeable to poc.
