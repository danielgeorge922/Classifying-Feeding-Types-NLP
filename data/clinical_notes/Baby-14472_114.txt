MOB called out requesting formula for infant. In to pt's room to discover how MOB wanted formula. Pt stated, "My right nipple is starting to bleed." Asked pt if I could assist her in hand expressing and then give expressed breast milk to inant. Pt stated, "No they are too sore not right now I want the formula." Told pt that I would support her in any decision she made but if she felt at any point she would like to try other ways to stick to just breastfeeding to let me know and I would be there to assist. Pt verbalized understanding and said, "Thanks." Re-educated pt about ways to rest and soothe sore nipples. Pt verbalized understanding. Encouraged pt to continue to stimulate and hand express right breast so that it would be as equally stimulated as left.
