Pt phoned L&D inquiring about bed availability for her IOL.  I had spoken with pt at request of her RN, [**NAME**], and explained to pt that there are not any beds available for her induction @ that time (0130).  I explained to pt that there are still not any beds available.   Reassured pt as soon as bed becomes available we will bring her to L&D.  That we want to be able to provide the best and safest care for her and her baby and have to wait until that is possible.   Pt was not satisfied with this explaination.  She insisted on speaking to a MD about the induction.   Stated she wanted to speak to someone higher than CN.  Phone call was given to Dr. [**NAME**].  Pt discussed with Hospital coordinator (DJ).
