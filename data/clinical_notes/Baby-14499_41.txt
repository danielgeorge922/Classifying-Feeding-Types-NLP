This note was copied from the chart of BOY/[**NAME**]. Lactation note:  In to see dyad. Infant recently extubated and first time at the breast. Mother experienced bf x 6 months with first son. Appears frustrated and worried while holding infant in cradle hold. Infant asleep and not showing feeding cues.   Breasts full round symmetrical Nipples everted intact Able to easily express drops of colostrum  Infant brought in better position, stomach to stomach. Ears, shoulders and hips in line. Taught mom nipple to nose and chin led latch to assure good milk transfer. Also taught shoulder and neck support and avoiding cradle hold to optimize latch and milk transfer. Discussed at length infant feeding cues and allowing STS and unrestricted access to the breast to allow infant opportunity to refamiliarize self with breast. Hand expressed several drops of colostrum into infants mouth--licked up.  No latch ever achieved but mother's confidence appeared improved. Encouraged continued pumping/hand expression. Mother likely d/c but infant not. Discussed rooming in, RMH, and hotel as options. Will f/u tomorrow and encouraged to page us if needs arise before rounds. Discussed with RN hand expression and syringe or spoon feeding if infant needs intake or supplementation at this time or before latch achieved.  Thank you for consult.
