FHT reviewed by Dr. [**NAME**]. Pt repositioned at this time to a  right lateral side tilt with oxygen in pace. Explained to pt that her positioning would assist with FHR variability. Pt refused to turn all the way over on to her right or left side and said she could only tilt to either side. Will continue to monitor
