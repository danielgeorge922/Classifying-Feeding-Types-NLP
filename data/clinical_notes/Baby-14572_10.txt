This note was copied from the chart of BOYB/[**NAME**]. Last night baby was noted with poor sucks and sleepy. Assisted latching to MOB breast, noted with colostrum on hand expression, baby was able to suckled 2-4x then sleep on breast. Stimulated face to wake, will latch but will go back to sleep again. AC glucose checked WNL. Encouraged MOB to continue hand expression and feed milk/colostrum per syringe/spoon. MOB and FOB was worried if baby was getting enough milk. Explained and educated on baby stomach size and how well colostrum will satisfy baby. Also encouraged on breast pumping to stimulate and increase milk production. Breast pumping supplies offered and educated to breast pump for atleast 15 minutes 8-10x in 24 hrs. No milk noted yet on breast pumping for now. This morning assisted with latching baby again to breast, baby more awake and noted with improved sucking reflex. Breast feeding materials given to MOB for additional info. Answered MOB questions and encouraged to call with breast feeding needs. Will refer to lactation team for further breast feeding education. Will continue to care.
