Asked to see new first time mom with twins to help latch babies on.  On exam breasts are pendulous. Nipples are flat but stretch easily and babies can latch. Both babies are sleepy. Pt says she knows how to hand express her breasts and has lots of colostrum .   Discussed importance of good position and latch to prevent nipple damage,( asymetrical, chin led latch ). Instructed mom to allow infant to finish one breast, using breast compressions to maximize feeding time before switching to second breast. Discouraged use of pacifiers and artificial nipples until breast feeding is well established. Encouraged mom to do STS as much as possible during first few days of life. Will provide mom with copy of [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] breast feeding booklet and make her aware of community resources available to her after discharge tomorrow as she is newly delivered and is overwhelmed.  Plan: Will continue to support mom's breast feeding goals. Left contact information for lactation resource nurse and encouraged mom to call for help and assistance.
