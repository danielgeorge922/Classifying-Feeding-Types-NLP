Please see previous social work service progress notes for continuity.  While covering service on this day, received and responded to call from bedside nurse to assist family with RMH.  Social work placed family on wait list and left RMH information for MOB at bedside, as she was not in her room and not at NICU bedside.  Social work plans to transfer case back to regular NICU social worker upon her return.
