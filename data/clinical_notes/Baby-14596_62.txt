Assisted pt to put baby to the breast in football hold, but it wasn't a comfortable position for the couplet.  Adjusted to a cross cradle hold and walked MOB through how to latch baby.  Assisted to latch baby with deep latch and good sucks.  Pt wasn't able to correctly demonstrate how to latch baby, and seemed uninterested in help from nursing staff.  Explained to MOB that baby has a low blood sugar and needs to eat, explained the process of hand expression and how to syringe feed, pt verbalizes understanding, will follow up.
