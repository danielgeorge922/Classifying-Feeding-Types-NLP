Rounded to provide lactation support - pt with multiple visitors in room, sibling visiting with infant.  Mother denies any difficulties with breastfeeding.  Pt did not seem comfortable discussing breastfeeding in front of visitors - left my name and contact info on communication board in room for pt to call when ready to feed - verbalized understanding.
