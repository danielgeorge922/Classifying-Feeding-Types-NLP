To room to re-place fetal monitoring. Discussed with the patient that the baby has not been on continuous fetal monitoring. I explained to the patient that if we are unable to monitor the baby we cannot see if the baby is in distress. The risks of not monitoring the baby include fetal hypoxia, resulting in transient or permanent disability, fetal death in utero, delay in emergent delivery for non-reassuring fetal heart rate tracing. The patient expressed understanding of these risks. I offered to bring the ultrasound into the room to quickly place the baby on the fetal monitoring to which the patient replied "I'm tracing the baby myself". I discussed with the patient that if she does not allow us to place the baby on fetal monitoring we would ask that she sign an AMA form for fetal monitoring due to the above stated risks to the fetus. The patient refused to sign the AMA form. The AMA form was completed and witnessed by the patient's nurse. The AMA form was placed on the chart without the patient's signature.   [**NAME**] M.D.
