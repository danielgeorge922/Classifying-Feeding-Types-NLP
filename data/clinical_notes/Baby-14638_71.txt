No involvement with anterior abdominal wall. Bladder adherent. Unclear if rectal involvement.  Liveborn infant male weighing 3124 grams with Apgars of 3, 6, and 6, at 1 minutes, five minutes, and ten minutes respectively.   CORD GASES: No Cord gases collected, Fetal DNA sample sent    SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY:  ID Type Source Tests Collected by Time  A :  Tissue Surg Path Umbilical Cord OPTIME SURGICAL PATHOLOGY TISSUE [**NAME**], MD [**DATE**] 1054     INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 40 y.o. female P2143 with history of prior cesarean x2, and  known placenta previa with suspected placenta percreta who was taken to the operating room for cesarean delivery at 36w5d gestation, with plan for staged hysterectomy approximately 24 hours later.   DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the Operating Room and placed on the operating table in the dorsal supine position.  A briefing was held and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was placed in low lithotomy position in Allen stirrups.  A final time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  It was confirmed that the patient had received prophylactic antibiotics and that pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.    Urology proceeded with diagnostic cytoscopy and bilateral ureteral stent placement (please see their operative note for further details).  Large varicosities seen through the bladder wall, not penetrating the mucosa. After completion of Urology portion of procedure, the patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion .   Entry:  The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a vertical midline incision above the umbilicus. The incision was taken down to the level of the fascia which was incised in the midline using scalpel.  The peritoneum was entered carefully with blunt dissection.   At this time a careful exploration of the pelvis was completed. A placenta percreta was confirmed, with placenta through myometrium and the lower portion of the uterus on the left and into bladder. At this time a sterile ultrasound probe was brought onto surgical field and used to plan hysterotomy. Decision was made to make a vertical hysterotomy near the right fundal region of the uterus in order to avoid the placenta. The hysterotomy was made with scalpel and gently extended with blunt dissection. The amnionitic fluid was clear upon rupture. The fetus was delivered via cephalic position. The cord was doubly clamped and handed off to the neonatal team who was at warmer in the operating room.     At this time the edges of the hysterotomy were closed with a running, locking suture of 0-Chromic for adequate hemostasis. The umbilical cord was tied and the placenta in-situ for later planned hysterectomy after extensive interventional radiology embolization. The hysterotomy was then closed in a running, locking fashion using a running suture of 0-Chromic. An additional suture of 2-0 vicryl was used to place a box stitch for additional hemostasis. Adequate hemostasis was ensured along hysterotomy.    The fascia was closed with a running suture of 0-PDS. Adequate hemostasis was ensured within subcutaneous tissue. The skin was then re-approximated with staples. A Bioguard dressing was placed over incision. A debriefing was held at the completion of the procedure; all counts were correct and no isses were identified.    Upon completion of cesarean delivery, patient was then transferred intubated to interventional radiology suite for further embolization of pelvic vessels, as planned for staged hysterectomy within 24 hours in order to minimize blood loss (please see their note for further details). Upon transfer to IR suite, patient was stable with minimal vaginal bleeding.   Dictated for Dr. [**NAME**], MD
