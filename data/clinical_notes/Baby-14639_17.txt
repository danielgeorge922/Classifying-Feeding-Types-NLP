Lactation rounds: baby in NICU 2  Went into see how pumping was going; Mom states ," they have her on a bottle over there, so I'm going to keep her on a bottle." She doesn't want to pump she says.  Left phone number and encouraged her to call me if she changes her mind. Pt verbalizes understanding.   Will support pt decision to bottle feed.
