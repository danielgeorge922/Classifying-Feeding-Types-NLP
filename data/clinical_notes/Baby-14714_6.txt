Normal uterus, tubes and ovaries bilaterally.  Minimal scar tissue present. Liveborn infant female weighing 3536 grams with Apgars of 9 and 9.  CORD GASES: (Arterial)  Lab Results  Component Value Date   PHCORDA 7.28 [**DATE**]     (Venous):  Lab Results  Component Value Date   PHCORDV 7.35 [**DATE**]    SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY: none   INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 28 y.o. female P1001 with history of prior cesarean section for arrest of dilation, and history of prior wound infection who presented for her scheduled repeat cesarean at 40w1d gestation as she declined trial of labor. Given dense keloid present at prior scar, decision was made to revise scar.   DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through patient's prior Pfannenstiel incision. The dense scar tissue present on left side of scar was excised in an ellipsoid manner. The incision was taken down to the level of the fascia which was incised in the midline. The incision was extended laterally in either direction over the rectus muscles. The fascia was dissected off the rectus muscle superiorly and then inferiorly. The rectus muscle was separated and the peritoneum was bluntly.  The bladder blade was placed. A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with the surgeon's fingers. The amniotic fluid was clear upon rupture.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood was obtained for analysis.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.  The uterus was exteriorized, and the uterine incision was closed in two layers, the first a running suture of 0 Vicryl and the second a running, imbricating suture of 0 Vicryl.    The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity.  Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision, posterior to the bladder, and in the subfascial area.  The fascia was closed with one suture of 0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissue was copiously irrigated closed with a interrupted sutures of 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with a running subcuticular closure of 3-0 Monocryl. Dermabond and a sterile Bioguard dressing were applied to the incision.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.  Dictated for Dr. [**NAME**], MD
