Spoke with patient with aid of certified Spanish interpreter, Dr. [**NAME**]. Patient again confirmed her desire for a tubal ligation with her cesarean section. She reiterated that she has wanted permanent sterilization since the beginning of her pregnancy and brought this issue up at several of her prenatal appointments. Unfortunately, she was never prompted to sign a Medicaid Federal Form during her pregnancy but did sign one along with an operative consent this admission. She is 40 yo and this will be her fourth child and second cesarean section. She was unable to afford routine antenatal testing for increased maternal age this pregnancy. Patient understands the risks and benefits of tubal ligation and again strongly desires this permanent sterilization. Discussed with patient that we will proceed with tubal ligation at the time of her cesarean section. She is in agreement with plan of care.   [**NAME**], MD
