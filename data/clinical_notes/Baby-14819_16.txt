Normal uterus, tubes and ovaries bilaterally.   BABY A:  Liveborn infant female weighing 2340 grams with Apgars of 7 and 9.  BABY B:  Liveborn infant male weighing 2086 grams with Apgars of 8 and 8.  CORD GASES: Arterial  BABY A:7.33 BABY B: 7.23  Venous  BABY A: 7.32 BABY B: 7.29   SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY:  Segments from each tube  INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 28 y.o. female P0202 with Di/Di twin pregnancy at 37 weeks, with history of CHTN (on labetalol 200 mg BID),prior cesarean x2, who presented for her scheduled repeat cesarean delivery with bilateral tubal ligation as she desired no future fertility. She was taken to the operating room for the above procedures.   DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through patient's prior Pfanenstiel incision. The incision was taken down to the level of the fascia which was incised in the midline with scalpel. The incision was extended laterally in either direction over the rectus muscles. The fascia was dissected off the rectus muscle superiorly and then inferiorly. The rectus muscle was divided sharply with a scalpel. The peritoneum was entered sharply in a clear space sharply. A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with the surgeon's fingers.  The amniotic fluid was clear upon rupture. Baby A was delivered from the Breech presentation.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood was obtained for analysis. Baby B was delivered from the cephalic position.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood was obtained for analysis.   The placentas were delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.  The uterine incision was closed in two layers, the first a running suture of 0 Vicryl and the second a running, imbricating suture of 0 Vicryl.    The right fallopian tube was identified to its fimbriated end and a defect was made in a relatively avascular portion of the mesosalpinx underlying the mid isthmic portion of the tube.  A segment of the mid isthmic portion of the tube was ligated with two sutures of 0 Chromic suture and the intervening portion of the tube excised and handed off the field; adequate hemostasis was assured.  The exact same procedure was performed on the opposite side after identifying that tube to its fimbriated end; again, adequate hemostasis was assured.  Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision, posterior to the bladder, and in the subfascial area.  The fascia was closed with a running suture of 0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and closed with a running suture of 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with a running subcuticular closure of 3-0 Monocryl. Dermabond was applied to the incision.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.  [**NAME**], MD
