Lactation rounds: breast fed 2 year old for 16 months  Mom states breastfeeding is going good. Mom has no concerns at this time. Mom breasts are soft and large; nipples are evert, intact and the right one has a small blister on. Mom's right nipple is longer than left nipple. Hand expression shown and a little of colostrum was able to be expressed out of both breasts. Mom was able to return demonstration.   Assisted mom with latching baby on right breast in the football position. Mom has no pain at this time. Discussed with mom the importance of an asymmetrical chin-led latch; pt verbalized understanding. I encouraged mom to keep baby close to help with getting her nipple to the soft palate of baby mouth to help with preventing nipple damage. Also reviewed to do breast compressions as she feeds to maximize feeding time. Pt verbalized understanding.   Left contact information on board and encouraged mom to call for assistance.   Will continue to support pt breastfeeding goals.
