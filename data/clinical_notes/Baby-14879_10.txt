Lactation rounds: Johanda, spanish interpreter assisted; first time breast feeding.  Pt states breastfeeding is going ok. Pt states the position (football) that she was taught isn't working. Encouraged mom to call when baby is ready to eat and I will help her with other positions or assist her with making football better since she had a c-section and be in pain. Left contact information on board.
