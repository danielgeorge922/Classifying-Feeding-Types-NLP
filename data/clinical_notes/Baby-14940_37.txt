Assessment: Pt feels breastfeeding is going very well.  States she initially was concerned about infant being sleepy, so was doing some pumping and feeding infant by spoon/bottle, but that now infant is feeding every hour most times.  Infant is currently breastfeeding in cross cradle position on left breast with average latch, pt denies any discomfort. States she nursed her first child also, some difficulty with tongue tie, resolved after frenotomy - denies any similar issues this time.  Breasts are soft, round.  Nipples are everted and intact.  Pt states she is aware of how to hand express her breasts, and colostrum noted bilaterally.   Intervention: Discussed importance of asymmetrical, chin-led latch, as well as allowing infant to determine feeding times by observing infant for feeding cues.  Instructed to allow infant to finish on one breast, using breast compressions to maximize feeding time before switching to second breast at each feeding.  Reviewed nipple care, typical cluster feeding behavior, infant stomach capacity and expected output for infant. Discouraged use of pacifiers or artificial nipples until breastfeeding is well-established, around 3-4 weeks of age. Encouraged maximizing skin to skin time with infant over the next several days as well.  Pt provided with a copy of the [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] Breastfeeding book and made aware of resources available to her after discharge. Pt plans to remain at home with infant.  Plan: Will continue to support pt's breastfeeding goals. Encouraged her to call for assistance as needed, and left contact information. Pt verbalized understanding.
