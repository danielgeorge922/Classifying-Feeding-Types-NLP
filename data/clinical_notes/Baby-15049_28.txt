This note was copied from the chart of GIRL/[**NAME**]. LACTATION:  Primip mother receptive to teaching.  States she has only been able to latch baby to the left breast using cradle hold. States she is able to hand express colostrum.  Denies nipple tenderness.  Breast:  Right breast round with appearance of everted nipple that retracts during pinch test but does not completely invert to the point that baby can not latch.  Left nipple not examined but mom states infant can latch well.    Discussed importance of obtaining a deep latch with potential need for further support using alternate positions like cross-cradle hold since mom prefers infant across her chest.  Demo for cc-hold using asymmetrical technique provided and mom able to latch baby with minimal suggestions after a few attempts.  Still practicing and encouraged to call staff and lactation as needed for additional support.  Infant w/ occasional "sucking" noises when not latched deeply and mom states she always makes that noise on the other breast but she thought that was a good sign.  Discussed s/s of active transfer with need to ensure proper latch.  Mom able to transition to cradle hold after infant nursing well and infant latches better on the right breast with less compression to the nipple and breast due to nipple retraction tendency with too much breast compression during latch.  Mom pleased with infant's feeding this time and family reports this is the best and longest she's fed.  Infant was still feeding after 30min. w/ notable swallows at completion of visit.  Breastfeeding book at bedside and reviewed:  Stomach capacity, feeding cues w/ goal of 8-12 feeds/24 hours, offering breast w/ observed cues, breast compression with pauses, milk storage guidelines with recommendations to begin pumping and storing for later use with introduction of a bottle using ebm if desired after breastfeeding is established around 4 weeks, and resources for support after d/c.
