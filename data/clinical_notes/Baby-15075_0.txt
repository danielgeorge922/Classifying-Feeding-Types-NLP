Attestation  I saw and evaluated the patient. I reviewed and agree with the findings and plan as documented in the note. I reviewed the patient's history. I have made corrections and additions as appropriate. I discussed this patient with the resident/fellow. Procedure performed: Emergency childbirth. I was present for the entire procedure. Key portion(s) of the procedure were Delivery of a full term living girl. The patient is critical due to Precipitous delivery. The patient required the following critical interventions: evaluating patient, reviewing labs and imaging, discussing with consulting physicians, critical considerations of the case, management of IV medications and drips, documenting in chart and discussing with patient and/or patient's family.The aggregate time I personally spent providing critical care to this patient (minus procedure time) was 30 minutes.    Comments: 23 year old female, brought from a POV with crowning, patient thought she was 30 wks, unclear prenatal care, the patient was placed immediately in Trauma 4 where the patient was disrobed to the waist to reveal a already delivering head. The shoulders and body were delivered expeditiously and a nuchal cord was discovered. Immediate action to clamp times two and cut were made while cord was simultaneously relieved manually from the neck. Mom was otherwise stable at this point and attention was directed toward the infant referenced separately. OB responded emergently and attended to the delivery of the placenta. Patient was taken to OB in stable condition. [**NAME**], DO 8:35 PM [**DATE**]
