Pt is up in the chair and reports that pain is well controlled with minimal bleeding with no blood clots today. Pt reports that breastfeeding is going well but would like to begin pumping, set her up with pump and supplies, began education on frequency of pumping and how to clean supplies. Asked pt to call out next time she puts the baby to breast so we can assess the latch as she is needing to use a nipple shield right now. Will recommend lactation consult. Pt denies feeling lightheaded or lethargic and all questions have been answered at this time. Husband at the bedside holding baby. Will ctm.
