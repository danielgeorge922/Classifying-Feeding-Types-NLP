Patient has been pushing with nursing for approximately 1hr and 15 min.  Patient re-evaluated by me to assess effectiveness of pushing.  Patient effectively pushing, however, has made minimal progress.  Presenting part is now at +1 station.  Minimal caput.  As patient has never had a vaginal delivery and has dense regional anesthesia, will allow to continue pushing for total of 2 hours.  Fetal heart rate tracing remains reassuring.  [**NAME**]
