Normal uterus, tubes and ovaries bilaterally.  Liveborn infant female weighing 4206 grams with Apgars of 8 and 9.  Indication: [**NAME**] is a 33 y.o. female para 3003 who presented at 35w4day with severe Preeclampsia and prior cesarean x2.    Procedure: After satisfactory anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped in a routine fashion for abdominal surgery.  Time-out confirmed patient and procedure.  The abdomen was entered with a low pfannensteil approach and dissected down to the level of the fascia with sharp dissection and cautery. The fascia was scored in the midline and extended laterally with sharp dissection. The anterior leaf of the fascia was grasped upwards and the underlying rectus muscle was dissected with sharp and blunt dissection. This was also performed inferiorly. The rectus muscles were separated in the midline and the peritoneum was entered. There were dense omental adhesion to to anterior surface of the uterus and to the anterior abdominal wall. They were dissected. 1 omental adhesion was clamped, cut and tied. Hemostasis was assured. An alexis O retractor was placed. The underlying uterus exposed.  A bladder flap was not created.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and extended laterally with blunt dissection.  Amniotic fluid was clear.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation and gave a spontaneous cry.  The cord was clamped and cut and the baby handed to the pediatrician.  Blood for gases and DNA was obtained.  The placenta was delivered with cord traction.  The uterus was exteriorized and wiped out with a lap.  The uterus was closed in a double layer closure using 0-Monocryl. The initial layer was a running locked layer and the second layer was an imbricating layer.The uterus was placed back into the peritoneal cavity. The uterine incision was hemostatic and uterine tone adequate. The fascia was inspected superiorly and inferiorly and was found to be intact and hemostatic.  The fascia was closed with 1 suture/s of 0-Vicryl starting at the angle and running in a continuous fashion. The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and closed with 2-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with 3-0 monocryl.  Dermabond was applied.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.   [**NAME**]
