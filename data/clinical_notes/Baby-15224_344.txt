LACTATION  Mother excited for her success with pumping so far.  Using 30mm flanges and preemie+ setting as instructed.  Has been using pumping log (pumping ~7x/day so far) and last pumping at noon was 14mls but she states milk was still coming out when the pump shut off.  States she is aware of how to hand express and encouraged her to attempt the further empty the breasts after pumping by hand expressing.  Reports her breasts are full and heavy and she feels her milk has come in.  Advised to use standard pump setting now since milk onset is present.    On the waiting list at [**LOCATION_OTHER**] and plans to stay local due to lack of resources to commute back and forth from Salt Springs.  Anticipating d/c possibly tomorrow.  Encouraged to use HG pump at RMH, at infant bedside in NICU or in NICU pumping room, and demo for harmony manual pump provided for interim use till insurance pump arrives as supplied by Medicaid.  Reviewed milk storage guidelines for transporting milk to the hospital.    Mom w/o additional questions and encouraged to call for support as needed throughout infant's hospitalization or as needed.  Desires to advance to breastfeeding as soon as infant able.
