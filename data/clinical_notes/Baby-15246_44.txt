R4 Progress Note:  Reviewed patient's glucose management.  Prior to admission she had just been diagnosed with GDM with 2hour GTT ([**DATE**]) of [**DATE**].  Based on these results as well as pt's BMI of 35, there was some concern of T2DM, but patient had never been previously diagnosed.  Since arrival, her glucose has been persistently elevated, but she has been receiving a betamethasone course, which may also be affecting her glucose control.  HgbA1c from [**DATE**] = 5.6.    Her glucose values since arrival are charted below for reference.  Date Time Fasting glucose Med Time 1hr post-breakfast Med Time 1hr post-lunch Med Time 1hr post-dinner Med  10/1 0628 142  1003 132 drip@1 1230 141 drip@1 1848 215 4u  10/2 0644 132 0 1026 187 3u 1333 160 3u     10/3                                                         She was initially being treated as GDM - diet control - and no treatment was provided.  With increasing blood sugars, an insulin drip was started, but patient eventually refused this management.  Currently, her glucose is being checked fasting and one hour postprandial with each meal.  She is covered with a sliding scale, which has been adjusted to account for tighter control in pregnancy (listed below).  MEDIUM DOSE Insulin Administration Instructions.  For OB patient, please add 2u to sliding scale as noted below. _______________________________________________ Blood Sugar  71-130 No insulin 71-150       No Insulin 131-200        1 unit 201-250        3 units  251-300        5 units 301-350        7 units  351-400        9 units  Greater than 400    11 units; Administer dose and notify MD  As she has persistently required insulin over the last 48hrs, will start glyburide 5mg qAM with first dose to be given [**DATE**].  Will continue to monitor glucose and given sliding scale insulin as appropriate.  Expect diminished need for insulin as effects of steroids wear off over the next few days.  [**NAME**], MD
