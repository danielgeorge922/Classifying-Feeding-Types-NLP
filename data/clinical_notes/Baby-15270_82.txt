Delivered by :  Primary Low Transverse Cesarean Section B-Lynch Stitch Bilateral Parkland Tubal Interruption  Hospital Course:  [**NAME**] is a 38 y.o. female para 0311 who presented to L&D at 28w5d gestation wit PPROM. Her other prenatal complications are listed under pre-operative diagnoses above. For further details see admission H&P from [**DATE**]. She was admitted and started on Mg for neuroprotection. She had recently received a BMS course (completed [**DATE**]) therefore this was not initially repeated. She was stable for approximately 36 hours although FHR tracing showed occasional decelerations and segments of decreased variability. On [**DATE**] she developed increasingly painful contractions. On exam the cervix was noted to be 4cm dilated with the cerclage pulling through. Additionally, she was found to have purulent vaginal discharge and fundal tenderness. Given overall clinical picture concerning for chorioamnionitis, the stitch was removed and she was started on antibiotic treatment. After several hours, the cervix was dilated to only 6cm, therefore she was also augmented with pitocin. Over the next 4 hours, no significant cervical change occurred. The FHR tracing showed decreased variability and more frequent decelerations. Given nonreassuring fetal heart rate tracing with minimal BTBV, small accelerations, and early vs late decelerations, despite conservative intrauterine measures in the setting of likely chorioamnionitis plan was made to proceed with cesarean section at this time. It was confirmed that the patient still desired tubal ligation regardless of the outcome of the pregnancy. Postoperatively the pt is doing well. By POD2 she was able to ambulate, void, and tolerate a regular diet.Her suagrs werre well ctonrolled on AM: 18nph/15R and PM: 15NPH/7R Her pain was well controlled and her lochia was less than menses. She will be discharged home in stable conditon.   Discharge Instructions for patients Who Have Had a Cesarean Delivery  You may immediately resume your usual diet.
