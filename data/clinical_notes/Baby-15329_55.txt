 Ms.[**NAME**] is being induced due to pre-E at 33.4 weeks of gestation. I have met with her and discussed the risks of prematurity. I have talked about respiratory distress, possibility of feeding intilerance and infections. She is planning to bottle feed baby and I have encouraged her to try breastfeeding. Ms.[**NAME**] is quite anxious and was tearful during conversation. She had IUFD during previous pregnancy at around 34 weeks. I encouraged her to ask questions regarding any aspect of infant care. She didn't have any questions at the time of our meeting. Her nurse was present during our conversation.  [**NAME**] MD, FAAP [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] Neonatology PGY-5
