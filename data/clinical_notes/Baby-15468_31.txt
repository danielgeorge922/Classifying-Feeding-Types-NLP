This note was copied from the chart of GIRL/[**NAME**]. After weighing baby, MOB put infant to breast and immediately noted pain.  Explained to MOB how to take infant off the breast, MOB attempted to latch infant again and again exclaimed "ow!" Asked MOB for permission to assist with latching infant.  Noted that MOB's right nipple now had a crease in the center.  Attempted to latch infant in cross cradle which MOB was comfortable with, and was unsuccessful d/t pain MOB experienced.  Latched infant to mom's breast in football hold. Pointed out to MOB the assymetrical latch, that infant more of the areola in her mouth than not.  MOB stated that it was uncomfortable at first, but that the discomfort went away.  Will ctm and assist.  Pt's primary nurse given the Breastfeeding Booklet in Spanish to give to the MOB and discuss.
