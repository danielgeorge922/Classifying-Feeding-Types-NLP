I went to see Mum because Jeah RN reports that baby has not breast fed for over five hours. He is sleepy and will not wake up.    When I entered the room baby was being held by Dad, dressed and wrapped. Mum is concerned that baby has not eaten since 0600 this morning. Baby is not yet 24 hours old but since birth, he has latched and has breast fed "well" according to Mum. He has had urine and stool output. I encouraged her to keep baby STS and showed her how to hand express her colostrum. Her breasts are soft and large with everted nipples. We hand expressed about 0.5 ml and baby took this off a spoon. I assured Mum that this can be normal for newborns. She will call for help when baby wakens. [**NAME**] LRN CLC
