This note was copied from the chart of GIRL/[**NAME**]. Lactation note:  Called to assist with latch following induction and vaginal delivery for IUGR infant. Mother is G1 P1, tobacco smoker. Desires to bf. Infant laying STS on mother's chest, not actively rooting.   Breasts soft round symmttrical Nipples short but everted. Intact. (Left looks bruised on tip, but is baseline for mother). Periareolar edema noted .  Able to easily hand express large drops of colostrum, which infant licked off, but infant unable to open mouth and coordinate tongue to achieve effective latch to bare breast. I didn't want infant to burn too many calories or wait too long to take in calories, so size 20 nipple shield applied. Infant immediately latched, sucked and swallowed in coordiated effort for > 20 minutes. Mother denied pain. As infant would slow sucks, mother provided breast massage to further optimize breastfeed. Colostrum noted in shield.   Hand expressed other breast for mother and obtained 1 mL of colostrum in syringe for later use as needed. Discussed milk storage guidelines.  Since infant is IUGR and LPTI, instructions included.  1. STS as much as possible 2. Feed based on cue but do not go longer than 3-4 hours without offerring breast and/or EBM 3. If feed is not optimal, encouraged pumping 10-15 minutes after that feed.   Discussed tobacco withdrawal s/s, as mother is smoker.   Will f/u as needed. Expect mother to need a home pump for further stimulation and additional help obtaining effective latch on the bare breast.
