Liveborn infant male weighing 3768 grams with Apgars of 8 and 9.  SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY: Placenta  INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 30 y.o. y.o. female para 0 at 39 weeks 5 days gestational age who presented for rupture of membranes at term. She was initially 5cm. She began having recurrent prolonged decelerations to the 60s and decision was made to proceed with cesarean delivery.   DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table. A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed. After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfannenstiel incision. The subcutaneous tissue was incised with the scalpel. The fascia was scored with a scalpel. The fascial incision was extended bilaterally with gentle traction.  The peritoneum was entered bluntly. The peritoneal incision was extended with traction and electrocautery.  A bladder flap was created. A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended with traction. The amniotic fluid was clear. The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation. The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood were obtained for analysis. The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap. The uterine incision was closed in two layers, the first a running suture of 0 Vicryl and the second a running, imbricating suture of 0 Vicryl.   Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision. Hemostasis was achieved in the subfascial area. The fascia was closed with a running suture of 0 Vicryl. The subcutaneous tissue was closed with a running suture of 3-0 Vicryl. The skin was closed with a running subcuticular closure of 4-0 Monocryl. Dermabond was applied to the incision. The vagina was cleared of clots. All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.  Complications: none  [**NAME**], MD
