Mom states the baby is not opening her mouth to latch and she gave the baby a bottle and even with the bottle the baby had a hard time sucking. I put sugar water on the bottom lip and put my finger in the baby's mouth and the baby sucked and brought her tongue out.. I put the baby on the breast in a football hold and the baby fussed alittle and latched on and had a good latch and a nutritive suck. Pumping was initiated this am and mom gave the baby 15 minutes
