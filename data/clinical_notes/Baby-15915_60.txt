I spoke with the primary team this am including Dr. [**NAME**] I had reviewed the MRI studies as well as neurosurgery notes and attempted to see the patient in the afternoon but she was being cleaned up at that time. Later in the afternoon I was called and the primary team had decided to take her for c section. The MRI findings were interesting but difficult to explain. It appeared that she had adherence of a large section of the ventral cord beginning at around T4 (localizes well to her exam). Contrast was not given given the pregnancy. Neurosurgery had recommended EMG. While it was thought that this could possibly be helpful it will not be something that will happen over the weekend.  The patient will be signed out to Dr. [**NAME**] who will be rounding tomorrow.
