Gross blood and clot after uterine incision confirming concern for abruption. No intrabdominal adhesions. Liveborn infant male weighing 885 grams with Apgars of 4 and 5.  SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY: Placenta  INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 33 y.o. female para 0010 at 26w2d who has been inpatient for PPROM since [**DATE**] (23w4d). There was a concern for partial abruption given intermittent episodes of bleeding and fetal decelerations. She was on labor and delivery for magnesium for neuroprotection and continuous electronic fetal monitoring. Around 0730 she developed 20/10 pain with contractions and more bleeding. FHT showed recurrent variable decelerations that did not respond to resuscitative measures. Decision made to proceed with cesarean delivery for suspected abruption.  DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.   A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  The patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.    After the establishment of adequate general anesthesia, the abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfannenstiel incision.  A bladder flap was not created.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with traction.  Blood and clot were noted on entry into the uterus. Minimal blood tinged amniotic fluid secondary to  history of PPROM.  The above described infant was delivered from the Breech presentation.  Delayed cord clamping was performed for about 20 seconds. The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood was obtained for analysis.  The placenta was delivered with little to no traction on the cord and appeared clinically separated from the uterine wall suggestive of abruption, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.  The uterus was exteriorized, and the uterine incision was closed in two layers, the first a running suture of 0 Monocryl and the second a running, imbricating suture of 0 Vicryl.    The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity.  Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision and in the subfascial area.  The fascia was closed with a single running suture of 0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissue was closed with interrupted sutures of 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with a running subcuticular closure of 3-0 Monocryl.  Dermabond was applied to the incision.  The vagina was cleared of clots. There cerclage was removed. All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.  Complications: None Dictated for Dr. [**NAME**].
