Problem: Sleep Deprivation Goal: Reports improved sleep pattern Outcome: Ongoing Pt experiencing insomnia with very little sleep in the last few days. Pt verbalizes that it is a result of anxiety about her diagnosis as well as fear of having nightmares as the last time she slept, she experienced some traumatic nightmares. RN listened to patient and then educated on the importance of sleep in improving some of the symptoms that she is experiencing such as fatigue, stress, anxiety and feeling her mind "racing". Pt states that she has been resistant to trying any new medications because of potential side effects. RN discussed PRN Benadryl use with her and she is willing to try it tonight. I assured her that I would monitor her closely and will assist her when she gets oob to ease her mind. She was in agreement with this plan.
