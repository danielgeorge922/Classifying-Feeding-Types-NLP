Pt requested RN and the Charge Nurse to the restroom while she was in the shower. The patient was standing there asking for " a DNA test to be done now ". We explained that this could not be done at this time and encouraged her to calm down and get back to bed.  At this time she stated that " he tried to hit me" and " he does not think that she is his baby". The Pt and her husband continued to argue in arabic. The Pt then asked for a " CNA or a sitter to watch over me". The Charge Nurse encouraged  the husband to go home or sleep in the TV room. The husband stated "everything is fine here" and " we will go to sleep".They were told that security would be called.  The Pt then said "I don't want him to leave".
