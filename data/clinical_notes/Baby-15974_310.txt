Please see previous sw note for continuity. I met with pt after speaking with legal and let her know that there do not appear to be any legal problems with her leaving the hospital if she is medically cleared for d/c before parents arrive. I also let her know that Open Arms agreed to fax birth plan and surrogacy contract, so her husband does not need to bring it with him when he visits this weekend. Wished pt a happy birthday.
