Department of Pediatrics Division of Neonatology  Consult Date: [**DATE**]  Reason for request: Preterm 33wk, severe preeclampsia. This consultation was requested by OB/GYN.   I spoke this morning with Ms. [**NAME**] regarding what to expect once her baby is born. I explained to her all the possible procedures that may need to be done as part of the medical care for her baby. I explained her the most common  complications that a 33wk premature baby may have during the hospitalization (respiratory, feeding, infectious issues). She verbalized to understand everything and did not have any question.
