Please see previous Social Worker (SW) notes for continuity. Informed Charge RN [**NAME**] [**NAME**], MGM ([**NAME**]), PGM ([**NAME**]) and ,[**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] / Sequel staff person ([**NAME**]) of plan for discharge tomorrow.which has been discussed and approved yesterday by [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] [**NAME**] as well as [**LOCATION_CITY**] Academy Director [**NAME**]. .As the Limited Power of Attorney document that is on file in baby's chart is NOT a Custody Agreement and does NOT allow [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] personnel to give MGM [**NAME**]  the baby upon discharge, baby can only be physically given to MOB [**NAME**] with supervision of [**LOCATION_CITY**] Academy staff. MOB will then exit the unit in possession of the baby with [**LOCATION_CITY**] Academy oversight.  Per, Mr [**NAME**], there are no court orders in place to prohibit this action at the instance of discharge from this hospital admission for baby and MOB. (The Limited Health Care Power of Attorney form was meant to allow MGM to assume custody of the baby upon discharge when MOB returns to [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] but the form is not the proper document for legal guardianship/custody and is not properly completed  to give POA either).  All parties involved verbalized understanding. MBU SW [**NAME**] will be available tomorrow to assist with discharge if needed.  PGM [**NAME**] says her son is on the floor in another room and has seen the baby twice but is not allowed to be at MOB"s bedside per [**LOCATION_CITY**] stipulations. PGM asked re: FOB's legal rights. Gave her name and number of Family Legal office/Family Court in both Lee and Collier Counties (FOB lives in [**LOCATION_CITY**], MOB's family lives in [**LOCATION_CITY**]). She says she will call on Monday as offices are closed over the weekend.  SW will continue to follow.  [**NAME**], MSW Peds Social Work Case Manager
