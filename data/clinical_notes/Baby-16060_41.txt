Assessment: Was asked by bedside RN to visit mom as she is complaining of sore nipples.   Mom says breastfeeding is painful with the baby making her nipples very sore. On exam breasts are wide spaced, soft and slightly triangular in shape. Nipples are red and sore, with small blister visible on right side. Baby is showing active feeding cues.Pt says she does not  know how to hand express her breasts, therefore explained and demonstrated hand expression to mom. Small drops of colostrum see. Mom says she did notice breast growth during pregnancy and has also seen colostrum leaking from nipples before delivery..   Assisted mom to latch baby using cross cradle hold initially but mom complained this was uncomfortable. Repositioned baby using football hold on left side and mom said this felt better. Baby was able to latch and was seen to be swallowing. Showed mom how to unlatch baby from breast correctly to prevent nipple damage.   Discussed importance of good position and latch to prevent nipple damage,( asymetrical, chin led latch ). Instructed mom to allow infant to finish one breast, using breast compressions to maximize feeding time before switching to second breast. Discouraged use of pacifiers and artificial nipples until breast feeding is well established. Encouraged mom to do STS as much as possible during first few days of life.  Provided mom with copy of [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] breast feeding booklet and made her aware of community resources available to her after discharge.  Plan: Will continue to support mom's breast feeding goals. Left contact information for lactation resource nurse and encouraged mom to call for help and assistance.
