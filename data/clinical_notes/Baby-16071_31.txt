CORD GASES: (Arterial)  Lab Results  Component Value Date   PHCORDA 7.20 (L) [**DATE**]     (Venous):  Lab Results  Component Value Date   PHCORDV 7.25 (L) [**DATE**]   SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY: Placenta   INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 38 y.o. female P0030 with history of morbid obesity, and suspected fetal coarctation of the aorta who underwent an induction of labor with a foley catheter and misoprostol. She progressed to 5-6 cm and completley dilated, but made no further cervical change despite adequate contractions. She was taken to the operating room for a primary cesarean. During dosing of her epidural per anesthesia she was noted to have respiratory distress consistent with a high spinal. An emergent cesarean section was performed with conversion to general anesthesia.   DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed. During dosing of her epidural per anesthesia she was noted to have respiratory distress consistent with a high spinal. An emergent cesarean section was performed with conversion to general anesthesia.   The patient was already in the dorsal supine position, and her abdomen was draped in a STAT manner.  A second time-out was quickly taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed. The neonatology team was called to OR. It was confirmed patient had received her prophylactic antibiotics shortly and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning after skin incision was made.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfannenstiel incision. The incision was taken down to the level of the fascia which was incised in the midline with scalpel. The incision was extended laterally in either direction over the rectus muscles. The peritoneum was entered bluntly.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with the surgeon's fingers. The amniotic fluid was foul smelling and meconium stained upon hysterotomy.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood was obtained for analysis.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.  The uterus was exteriorized, and the uterine incision was closed in two layers, the first a running suture of 0 Vicryl and the second a running, imbricating suture of 0 Vicryl.  Additional intravenous pitocin was administered as uterine tone was boggy.   The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity and uterine tone improved. Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision, posterior to the bladder, and in the subfascial area. The posterior cul de sac and bilateral paracolic gutters were wiped clean with a lap.  The fascia was closed with two sutures of 0 Vicryl beginning from either end of the incision and meeting in the midportion.  The subcutaneous tissue was copiously irrigated and closed with multiple running layers of 3-0 Vicryl. The skin was closed with a running subcuticular closure of 3-0 Monocryl.  Dermabond, and a sterile Bioguard dressing were applied to the incision.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  Patient was extubated without complication per anesthesia. All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.
