Assumed c/o pt.  External monitor x 1 in place & recording.  Pt denies contractions.  She said she has pain each time she voids.  MD are aware & labs are ordered labs for the next time she voids.  Pt states she's "had a rough day.  I guess they told you I had a meltdown".  I reminded her that she didn't get much sleep last night.  I encouraged her to sleep tonight & received an order for benedryl if she needs it.  Pt denies pain, cramping, bleeding at this time.  She states understanding to notify RN immediately if any of these things occur.
