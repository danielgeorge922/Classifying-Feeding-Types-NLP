Liveborn infant male weighing 3364 grams with Apgars of 8 and 9.  SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY: Placenta  INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 36 y.o. female para 1011 at 38w5d GA with pregnancy complicated by diet-controlled gestational diabetes, advanced maternal age who presents with spontaneous rupture of membranes and breech fetal malpresentation. Given the fetal malpresentation the decision was made to proceed with delivery by cesarean section.   DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfannenstiel incision.  The subcutaneous tissue was incised with electrocautery. The fascia was scored with the scalpel. The fascial incision was extended with curved mayo scissors and gentle traction. The fascia was dissected away from the rectus muscle with a combination of sharp and blunt dissection. The rectus muscle was divided at the midline. The peritoneum was entered bluntly. The peritoneal incision was extended with electrocautery. A bladder flap was created.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended with traction.  The amniotic fluid was clear.  The above described infant was delivered from the Breech presentation using standard breech maneuvers.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood were obtained for analysis.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.  The uterus was exteriorized, and the uterine incision was closed in two layers, the first a running suture of 0 Monocryl and the second a running, imbricating suture of 0 Monocryl. An additional figure of eight suture of 0-Monocryl was placed along the hysterotomy for hemostasis.    The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity.  Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision and in the subfascial area.  The fascia was closed with a single running suture of 0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissue was closed with a running suture of 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with a running subcuticular closure of 3-0 Monocryl.  Dermabond was applied to the incision.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.  Complications: none  [**NAME**] M.D.   I was scrubbed and present for the entire case.  I reviewed the resident's note and made appropriate corrections and additions to it.   [**NAME**], MD
