MOB reports she no longer attends high school, indicating she left because she was experiencing bullying.

MOB reports feeling bonded to newborn and reports her plans to pump and breast feed, but will bottle feed to supplement.  When asked, MOB reports she is aware of how to pump and how to put the pump together.  Nursing has noted concerns related to MOB's ability to feed newborn without prompts, as well as providing misinformation about how much she had fed the baby.  MOB indicted to social work how often and how much to feed newborn and reported her last feeding and when the next feeding is expected.  MOB reports she has fed newborn, but reports FOB "feeds him best."  MOB reports she has changed newborn diapers, but reports FOB and family have initiated more "so I can rest."  MOB was encouraged to actively participate in newborn care so she can practice, learn, and ask questions while support staff is present.  Throughout this assessment, MOB appeared relaxed, open, honest and forthcoming.  At the end of this assessment, MOB was observed with the baby after he returned from a procedure.  He initially appeared inconsolable and social work offered some ideas for MOB that might make him comfortable, which MOB immediately attempted; baby responded well.  MOB reported feeling "nervous" and appeared insecure while soothing the baby.  Social work offered encouragement, because although MOB did not appear confident, she appeared soothing and loving with newborn.    The following day, and just prior to discharge, social work met again with MOB while FOB and her mother were at bedside. They actively participated in this assessment with MOB's permission.
