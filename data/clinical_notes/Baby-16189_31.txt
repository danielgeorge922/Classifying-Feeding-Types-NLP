This note was copied from a baby's chart. RN finished with physical assessment, infant crying and gave occasional feeding cues. RN assisted MOB with positioning infant in foot ball hold, infant fell asleep immediately on breast. RN attempted to stimulate infant awake, infant responds briefly to stimulus but goes back to sleep. RN placed gloved pinky in infant's mouth, sucked once or twice and fell asleep. RN instructed MOB to hand express colostrum into infant's mouth. RN noted small drop of colostrum from left nipple and good supply on right side. Infant would swallow colostrum, but did not show any interest in latching onto breast. RN had MOB hand express until supply stops and watch infant for feeding cues and try to latch infant on when cues are present. MOB verbalized agreement.
