Disposition: stable  Operative Report and Findings: The patient was taken to the operating room and there under epidural anesthesia her abdomen was draped and prepped in the usual sterile fashion.  A pfannenstiel incision was made and the various anatomical layers were dissected down to the layer of the parietal peritoneum.The parietal peritoneum was entered with aid of hemostats and Metzenbaum scissors. A bladder flap was established with aid of Metzenbaum scissors.  A transverse incision was made on the lower uterine segment and spread with blunt finger dissection.  A viable male infant was delivered  and handed to the NICU unit on standby.  The cord was noted to be around the neck. The placenta was manually removed and the uterus was closed with a continuous interlocking layer of 0-PDS suture.  The uterine incision was then reinforced with a second continuous imbricating layer of 0-PDS.  The parietal peritoneum was then closed with a continuous layer of 000-vicryl.  The muscles was closed with 3 interrupted sutures of 000-vicryl.  The fascia was closed with a continuous layer of 0-PDS starting a suture from both corners of the incision.  The subcutaneous layer was closed with a continuous layer of 000-vicryl and a jackson-pratt drain was placed in the subcutaneous layer.  The skin was closed with a subcuticular stitch of 0000-proline suture.  The jackson pratt drain was sewn in with an interrupted suture of 000-nylon.
