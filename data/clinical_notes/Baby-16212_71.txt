Rounded to offer pumping support - pt states she last pumped yesterday, and that it hurt when she turned up the suction, but finally got some colostrum out. States she planned to try pumping and breastfeeding, but was satisfied with infant receiving formula at this time in NICU. Briefly discussed the differences between breast milk and formula, emphasizing benefits to pt and her infant as an insulin dependent diabetic. Reinforced need to pump/hand express 8-10 times every 24 hours. Also reviewed expected pump volumes. Reviewed hand expression, pt able to demo with coaching, large drop noted after first attempt.  Pt declines assistance with pumping at this time.   Encouraged her and SO at bedside to read and become more familiar with the information on benefits of breastfeeding - referred to Kellymom.com, and reviewed Breastfeeding book with them. Left contact info on communication board for them to call for assistance as needed. Verbalized understanding.
