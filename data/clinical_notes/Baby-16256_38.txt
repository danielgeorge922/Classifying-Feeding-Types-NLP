Lactation rounds: has a 2 year old that she breast fed for 16 months  Mom states breastfeeding is going wonderful; mom does state she has a little soreness because she never had a baby that wanted to eat so much in the first 24 hours. I told mom eating frequently was a good thing because this will help bring her milk in, but the soreness needs to be assessed to make sure baby has proper latch. Pt verbalized understanding.   Baby is out of the room at this time getting screening done per mom. Lactation contact number was left on board and encouraged mom to call once baby is ready to feed.  Will continue to support pt breastfeeding goals.
