LACTATION:  Physician ordered consult received.  Infant scheduled for shunt placement tomorrow.  Mother planned to formula feed upon admission to L&D.  MBU RN states mom is formula feeding and has not begun pumping.  Mom states she has no desire to breastfeed her infant.  Discussed recommendations for infants to receive moms milk as the primary and optimal nutrition specific for that mom and baby.  Mom states she is unaware of the benefits of breastmilk and reviewed at this time:  benefits of breastmilk and risks of formula.  Expresses concerns for infant only wanting her and his father not being able to care for him because he's "always wanting me".  Discussed normal bonding that occurs between and mother/father and child with possibility of fob participating in feedings by giving breastmilk in a bottle (if preferred way) vs formula when he is home from being at sea.      Mom states she would consider pumping and providing breastmilk to infant but was unsure if she could commit to expressing 8-10 times/day.  Discussed supply and demand effect with importance to establish supply with frequent emptying and saving every drop for infant.  Breastfeeding book provided for patient to review some education and materials.  Pointed out the benefits of breastfeeding page, stomach capacity, and milk storage guidelines.  Mother states she will read the book and let lactation know if she desires to initiate pumping for her infant.  Thank you for notifying lactation of this infant's admission to the NICU.  Will wait to see if mom decides to provide ebm to infant as her original plans were to formula feed.  Please notify lactation if mom expresses an interest to pump, otherwise lactation will f/u tomorrow.   [**NAME**], RN, IBCLC Lactation Services [**CONTACT_PHONE**]  pager
