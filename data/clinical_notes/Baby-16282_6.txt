R4 Note   [**NAME**] is a 40 y.o. P0232 at 36w2d, with history of GHTN (elevated since 30 weeks, no meds), prior c/s x1, history of 4th degree perineal laceration, h/o eclampsia who presented to triage today with complaint of elevated blood pressures, LE edema, headache, and SOB.   Upon arrival she was noted to have elevated BPs, initial BP 152/87, and one severe range BP 161/87, which resolved without treatment. Pre E labs were normal, and Urine PrCr 138.  Decision was mad to begin Labetalol 200 mg TID, and admit her to mother baby unit for 24 hour urine and blood pressure and monitoring of additional neurological symptoms.   At this time she is continuing to have a headache, but no visual changes.   She is stating "She has to leave the hospital, because she needs to drive to Orlando to return a rental car."   I reviewed with patient that at this time, I would recommend she remain in the hospital for monitoring, as she may be developing preeclampsia. I discussed that she would need to sign out AMA if she wanted to leave. Pt states she will think about what she would like to do.   [**NAME**], MD
