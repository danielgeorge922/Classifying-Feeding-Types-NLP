Lactation rounds: 2nd baby; fed her son for 2 years and now he's 3 years old  Made another round to check on baby feedings, mom responded she is still sleeping, "I tried to put some colostrum on her lips and she fell back asleep." Asked mom if she wanted to try since I was in room, mom said, "sure."    With permission was able to examine mom's breasts. Breasts are large and soft; nipples are very big, round, and intact.  Attempted to latch baby on the right breast, hand expressed some colostrum and rub on gums. Baby still asleep. Was able to demonstrate hand expression and mom has a very good supply. Hand expressed 4 ml and spoon fed to baby, baby had a little spit up afterwards, she burped 2 times and mom shown how to swaddle and given back to mom. Mom was very appreciative.   Skin to skin was reviewed and its benefits. Discussed with mom to look out for feeding cues to know when baby is ready to eat. Pt verbalized understanding. Explained to mom she may have to hand express again and if she does call her nurse for assistance. Pt verbalized understanding.  Will continue to support pt breastfeeding goals.
