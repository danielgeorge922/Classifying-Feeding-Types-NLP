Assessment: Pt feels breastfeeding is going better than on the first day.  Expresses concern re: not knowing if she should pump or not. Infant using 20 mm nipple shield to assist with latch due to pt having flatter nipples, per pt. LC on first dol noted uncoridinated suck as well. Infant at 91.6% of birth weight this morning, currently infant is feeding on right breast in cross cradle position with nipple shield in place. Mother states infant feeding hurts sometimes, and other times is very comfortable. Both parents report they have been able to hear infant swallowing while feeding. Voiding and stooling as expected.  Breasts are soft, round, no identified risk factors for decreased milk supply.  Nipples are intact, everted, short, elastic areola easily gathered.  Pt taught how to hand express her breasts, and large drops of colostrum noted bilaterally.   Intervention: Infant unlatched, drops of colostrum present in shield, infant extending tongue well, no evidence of restriction. Infant suck on gloved finger reveals clamping of jaws at initial latch, and intermittent chomping with no relation to suck bursts. Occassional posterior humping of tongue. With permission, infant re-latched to right bare breast, able to latch and suck in bursts with visible/audible swallowing occasionally. Difficult to assess due to infant biting down and frequently pushing off of breat, turning head away. Repositioned to right breast in biological nurturing position, with same result - after several attempts did feed for approximately 5 minutes in bursts. Continued to fuss and arch/flex torso, offered burp, swaddled and re-latched in biologic position - able to feed more calmly for several minutes with audible swallowing. Started crying again, offered burp, then to left breast in modified clutch hold with infant "sitting up" to nurse, continuing to bite down intermittently - applied nipple shield with infant latching well. Showed parents how to identify swallowing. Nursed for several minutes before falling asleep. Colostrum visible in shield.  Discussed importance of asymmetrical, chin-led latch, as well as allowing infant to determine feeding times by observing infant for feeding cues.  Instructed to allow infant to finish on one breast, using breast compressions to maximize feeding time before switching to second breast at each feeding.  Reviewed nipple care, typical cluster feeding behavior, infant stomach capacity and expected output for infant.  Also discussed managing possible milk oversupply during milk onset. Discouraged use of pacifiers until breastfeeding is well-established, around 3-4 weeks of age. Encouraged maximizing skin to skin time with infant over the next several days as well.   We discussed adding some pumping/hand expression after feeds to collect small amounts of expressed breast milk to offer infant via spoon when too fussy/hungry to calm and latch to breast, and as a supplement after feeding session - parents open to this, and have already been doing this the last 24 hours. Also encouraged to be vigilant for very early hunger signs to make initial latch easier.  Peds team entered room for evaluation of infant at this time - aware of infant weight loss, plan to discharge home today with f/u Monday. Made them aware of concerns with infant suck behavior, and reassured mother's milk supply adequate.  Pt has a copy of the [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] Breastfeeding book and made aware of resources available to her after discharge. Strongly encouraged parents to schedule appt with outpatient LC - state they have a Monday morning appt with [**NAME**] [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] Peds, counseled to call Monday morning and request breastfeeding appt as well to assess infant latch, expected onset of lactogenesis 2 , use of nipple shield, infant suck.   No immediate plans to return to work.   Plan: Will continue to support pt's breastfeeding goals. Parents to schedule appt with outpatient breastfeeding clinic.  Encouraged her to call for assistance as needed, and left contact information. Pt verbalized understanding.
