Started pushing @ 0427 - Pt wanted to wait till partner arrived after becoming complete. Pushed X 2 with pt, fetal head made good descent, Dr. [**NAME**] and Peds 111 called for delivery due to gestational age.    Pt delivered viable male infant by SVD. Delayed cord clamping was preformed for 30 seconds, and infant was taken over to warmer to be assessed by peds.    Oxytocin bolus delivered before placenta delivery per policy.
