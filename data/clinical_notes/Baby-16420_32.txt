Liveborn infant male weighing 2090 grams with Apgars of 2, 6 and 8.  SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY: Placenta  INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 20 y.o. y.o. female para 0010 at 37 weeks 2 days gestational age who presented for induction after being diagnosed with severe range blood pressures and IUGR. She progressed to 5/C/-1. However, given recurrent prolonged variable decelerations the decision was made to proced wtih cesarean delivery. In the operating room, a level was unable to be obtained off her epidural and the decision was made to proceed with cesarean delivery under general anesthesia.    DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table. A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed. An adequate level was unable to be obtained with regional anesthesia. Given the concerning fetal heart rate tracing, the decision was made to proceed with emergent cesarean delivery under general anestheisa.  Once adequate general anesthesia was obtained, the abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfannenstiel incision. The subcutaneous tissue was incised to the fascia using the scalpel. The fascia was scored with a scalpel. The fascial incision was extended bilaterally with traction. The peritoneum was entered bluntly and then the incision was extended with traction.  A bladder flap was not created. A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended with traction.  The amniotic fluid was clear. The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation. The cord was milked and then doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood were obtained for analysis. The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap. The uterine incision was closed in two layers, the first a running suture of 0 Vicryl and the second a running, imbricating suture of 0 Vicryl.   Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision. The posterior cul de sac and bilateral gutters were irrigated. Hemostasis was achieved in the subfascial area. The fascia was closed two running sutures of 0 Vicryl starting at each angle and meeting at the midline. The subcutaneous tissue was closed with a running suture of 0 chromic. The skin was closed with a running subcuticular closure of 3-0 Monocryl. Dermabond was applied to the incision and then covered with a bioguard dressing. The vagina was cleared of clots. All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.  Complications: none  [**NAME**], MD
