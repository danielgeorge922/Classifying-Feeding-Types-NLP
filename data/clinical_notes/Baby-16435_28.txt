Lactation Note:  Stopped by to see how Mom is doing with pumping. States only seeing drops which I explained was normal @ this time. Encouraged Mom to pump/express frequently at least 8-10x in 24 hours as frequent stimulation is key to milk onset and a good supply. Mom has made appt @ WIC to procure hospital grade pump but states appt is in 1 week. Explained to Mom that this is not ideal as she will need more than a handpump to stimulate and express. Attempted to call local WIC office to reschedule appt for tomorrow or Wednesday but did not reach anyone yet. Will re-attempt to get this Mom rescheduled. Plan to continue support for this Mom to obtain ideal milk supply for her infant.                                                                               [**NAME**] RNC,IBCLC
