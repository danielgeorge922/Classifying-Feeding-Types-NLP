Patient is refusing an IV insertion and vitals. She stated 'I am not letting you stick me or take my vitals until I speak with a senior doctor". Patient was explained that an IV was needed in order to administer IV fluids to help her creatinine improve. I also explained the importance of measuring her BP. Patient and significant other are very adamant that we are not allowed to reinsert IV or take vitals until speaking with "senior doctor". MD was made aware of the situation.
