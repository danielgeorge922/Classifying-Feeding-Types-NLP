RN came to bedside to place oxygen and turn pt. Pt appeared more uncomfortable and stated that she was feeling the baby move more. RN palpated a contraction at that time. RN placed toco, started LR bolus and notified MDs. MD ordered Magnesium with 4 gram bolus which is infusing at this time. Pt provided with button to push to mark contractions. Will continue to monitor.
