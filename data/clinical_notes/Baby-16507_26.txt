MOB reports residing in a safe and stable home environment with her 18m old and FOB (FOB to newborn only).  MOB reports this was a planned and desired pregnancy and reports having all necessary infant care items at home.  She reports FOB is very involved and supportive and has been involved in her other childs' life for the last 15 months and is a loving father figure.    A review of medical records indicates MOB with a history of depression.  MOB reports she has experienced depression since she was a child, due to having an unstable childhood.  MOB reports she has a history of self-injurious behaviors (cutting), and reports she hasn't cut herself in at least 2 years.  MOB reports a mostly stable mood this pregnancy and denies SI or HI.  MOB reports she is aware of medication for treatment and reports she'll keep it in mind if she begins to develop symptoms, but reports she prefers to use her own coping skills -- music, writing, expressing herself to her partner.  MOB reports she wants to use medication as a last resort and chooses not to vaccinate her children.  She reports plans to take newborn to the same pediatrician as her other child, Dr. [**NAME**].  She reports she takes the baby to scheduled pediatric appointments and denies barriers to early and consistent pediatric care.    At this time, MOB declines referral for Healthy Families or Healthy Start, but was provided with their contact information should she change her mind.
