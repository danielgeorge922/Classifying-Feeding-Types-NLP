Liveborn infant female weighing 4224 grams with Apgars of 2, 6, and 8  SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY:  Placenta  INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 28 y.o. female para 1011 who presented to L&D for scheduled induction of labor in setting of prior cesarean section x 1.  Patient strongly desired trial of labor after cesarean section.  Patient progressed to 6 cm and then had recurrent variable decelerations therefore was taken to the operating room for repeat cesarean section.  DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.  The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfannenstiel incision.  A bladder flap was created.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended with traction.  The amniotic fluid was clear.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood were obtained for analysis.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.  The uterus was exteriorized.  The R and L corners were tied with 0-vicryl.  The R corner required additional reapproximation with a figure of eight of monocryl.  The uterine incision was then closed in a running suture of 0 monocryl.  The right corner serosa was reapproximated with 0-chromic.  The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity.  Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision and in the subfascial area.  Surgisnow was placed over the hysterotomy.  The fascia was closed with a single running suture of 0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with a running subcuticular closure of 3-0 Monocryl.  Dermabond was applied to the incision.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.  [**NAME**], MD OB/GYN PGY2
