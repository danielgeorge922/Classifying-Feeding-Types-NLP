Went to see patient - was not in MBU room, patient was visiting with baby in NICU with FOB.  Patient is appropriately upset.  She requests to go home.  She reports no pain.  Bleeding is minimal.  She lives in [**LOCATION_CITY**].  She reports good home support and FOB is supportive.  I asked if she needed anything from us before she left and she said "no."    I asked if she could come back in a week or 2 for postpartum visit in order to check on her, assess her mood, and discuss pregnancy events and recommendations for next pregnancy (cerclage), discuss contraception.  She agrees and says she needs to come back to pick up ashes next week too.  I offered condolences.  [**NAME**], MD
