MOB reported residing in her parents' home with her two older children. Mood and affect appeared to be within normal limits, although MOB made several odd comments during assessment. MOB confirmed that she did not receive prenatal care, advising that she had attempted to obtain an abortion when she was approximately five months pregnant. She further stated that she had not been able to undergo the procedure due to her advanced stage of pregnancy. When this writer inquired about MOB's lack of prenatal care following her discovery that she would not be able to obtain an abortion, MOB replied, "they told me I was going to have a boy, but I wound up having a girl. All of the baby stuff I have is for boys." This writer inquired again about the availability of prenatal care and MOB stated, "no one would touch me because they said I was high risk." MOB reported that she was not given a referral to a high risk OB clinic until approximately one week ago. MOB was unable to recall who eventually advised her to seek prenatal care through [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**], stating, "It was somebody on the phone. It may have been someone from MIC."  MOB reported that she began using oxycodone approximately two years ago for the treatment of a bulging disk. MOB stated that she received the medication through "pain management in Tampa." MOB was unable to recall the name of her physician. MOB reported that her pain management physician stopped treating her due to her pregnancy. She further advised that she "stopped taking the pills altogether," but later stated that she had decreased her dosage to approximately 15 mg every other day. MOB stated that she had decided to decrease her oxycodone use, but not stop altogether, based on the recommendation of "a doctor my mom talked to." MOB reported that her pain management physician had also prescribed Valium while she was receiving treatment at the clinic, stating that she'd still had some left form her last prescription.   MOB denied any history of DCF involvement. This writer advised MOB that, due to concerns for newborn safety, an abuse report would be filed with the Department of Children and Families. Anticipatory guidance was provided and MOB was encouraged to contact social work as needed. An abuse report was filed and accepted by the FL Abuse Hotline ([**CONTACT_PHONE**]-ABUSE). This writer spoke with Max, ID #: 735, who indicated that an investigator would respond within 24 hours. Please consult social work prior to newborn discharge.
