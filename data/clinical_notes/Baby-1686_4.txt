I have reviewed the resident's note and provided direct supervision for this service. I reviewed her history. She has had no prenatal care. Says she knows she is RH neg and got rhogam prior pregnancies, but not during this pregnancy. Her tox screen was positive for benzos and she has a hx of chronic narcotic use.  She desires permanent sterilization and has had two prior cesareans.   The patient was counseled about risks, benefits, alternatives, and indications of BTI including but not limited to pain,  bleeding, transfusion, infection, damage to adjacent organs, reaction to anesthesia, blood clot, death. She also understands the  permanence of procedure, 1% failure rate, and increased risk of ectopic pregnancy should she become pregnant. She knows that vasectomy and reversible methods of contraception are options. She expresses good understanding. The consents are signed and on the chart.   I was on the premises and immediately available at the time of service.
