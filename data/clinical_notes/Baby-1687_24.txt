R2 Notes  Preliminary results of amniocentesis discussed with MFM. Although WBC count is high in the amniotic fluid, in the setting of negative gram stain and normal glucose value, we will not plan for delivery at this time. However, until final cultures return we cannot definitively rule out subclinical choriamnionitis. We will begin antibiotics per the chorioamnionitis protocol to cover any subclinical infection she may have until the final cultures have resulted. We will finish her BMS course with her second injection tomorrow at 1130. We will CTM the pt closely for any worsening signs of infection or evidence of a different source for her elevated temperature. We considered tx with tamiflu to cover for possible flu. However the pt's symptoms are not classic for the flu and they have been present for greater than 72 hours so we will not plan to treat at this time. [**NAME**], MD
