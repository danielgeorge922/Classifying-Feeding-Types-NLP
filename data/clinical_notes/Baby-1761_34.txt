To bedside to evaluate patient after RN notified me that patient is still experiencing severe incisional pain despite changing from oral percocet to oral dilaudid 2 mg and IV morphine for breakthrough.   Upon entering the room, the patient was ambulating from the restroom with assistance from her husband and appeared to be in significant discomfort. She reported that her pain is mostly on the right side of her cesarean incision. On exam she exhibited tenderness to palpation on the superior aspect of the right side of the incision. No rebound or guarding. The incision is c/d/i with steristrips in place. She did exhibit fundal tenderness on my exam, however, she remains afebrile with last temp 37.6.   Will write to increase dilaudid dose to 2-4 mg PO Q4 hours. Reviewed with Dr [**NAME**], who recommended Toradol 30 mg IV Q6 x24 hours.   Will CTM.  [**NAME**], MD
