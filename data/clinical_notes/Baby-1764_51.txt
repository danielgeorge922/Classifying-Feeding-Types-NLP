Date of Surgery: [**DATE**]  Preoperative Diagnosis: 1) 32 week IUP2) Mono-Di twins3) IUGR twin B4) Nonreassuring antenatal testing of twin B  Postoperative Diagnosis: Same  Operation Performed: Primary Low Transverse Cesarean Section  Surgeon: Dr. [**NAME**]  Assisstant: Dr. [**NAME**], Dr. [**NAME**]  Anesthesiologist: Dr. [**NAME**]  Anesthesiology Assisstant: Dr. [**NAME**]  Anesthesia: Spinal  Pathology: placenta  EBL: 800 ml  Findings: Normal uterus, tubes and ovaries bilaterally.  Liveborn infant A, female weighing 1840 grams with Apgars of 8 and 9.  Liveborn infant B, female weighing 1035 grams with Apgars of 1, 1, and 3 at 1, 5, and 10 minutes.    Indication: [**NAME**] is a 34 y.o. female para 0 @ 32 weeks with mono-di twins versus di-di twins who has IUGR twin B, BPP 6/10 on two separate occasions, 2 off for NST and breathing.  Given nonreassuring testing on repetitive tests, patient was taken to the operating room for primary cesarean.  Although patient was cephalic, cephalic, patient opted for primary cesarean delivery to not stress baby B.  Procedure: After satisfactory anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped in a routine fashion for abdominal surgery.  Time-out confirmed patient and procedure.  The abdomen was entered with a Pfannenstiel approach.  A bladder flap was created and then a transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and extended laterally with the surgeons fingers.  Amniotic fluid was clear.  The above described infant A was delivered from the Cephalic presentation.  The above described infant B was delivered from the Cephalic presentation soon after the delivery of the first twin. The cords were clamped and cut and the babies were handed to the pediatrician.  Blood for gases and DNA was obtained.   The placenta was delivered with cord traction.  The uterus was wiped out with a lap.  The uterus was closed in a double layer closure using 0-vicryl for the first layer and 0-Monocryl for the second layer.  Additional sutures of 2-0 vicryl and 0-monocryl were placed for added hemostasis.  2 amps of methergine were given IM and the uterus was still boggy.  The patient was frog legged to assure that vaginal bleeding was minimal after closure of the uterus.  Bleeding was minimal but an additional 0.2 mg of methergine was given intrauterine.    The peritoneum was reapproximated using a running suture of 2-0 vicryl. The same suture was then used to reapproximate the rectus muscles in a running stitch.  The fascia was closed with 2 sutures of 0-Vicryl starting at each angle, running in a continuous fashion, and meeting in the middle. The subcutaneous tissue was closed using a running suture of 3-0 vicryl. The skin was closed with a running subcuticular suture of 3-0 monocryl. Steristrips and bandage was applied. The vagina was cleared of clots. All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.  [**NAME**]  Dictated for Dr. [**NAME**]
