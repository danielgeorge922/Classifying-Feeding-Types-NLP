Mrs. [**NAME**] gave birth to a 29 week infant that was admitted to the NICU due to RDS, risk of sepsis (prematurity, RDS, premature and prolonged rupture of membrane). Social work spoke with the parents today following a chart screening to provide support/information with Shahali's admission to NICU (reviewed the NICU parent handbook, informed of resources the floor and hospital has to offer).

Parents are receiving medical updates, they describe a support system and resources to prepare for Shahali. No concerns/needs reported at this time. Parents were informed how to reach me, social work will continue to follow and provide the indicated support/services.
