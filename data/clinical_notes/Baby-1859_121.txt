Mom is pumping. I gave mom written and verbal pumping instructions . She will pump every 2 hours during the day and every 3 hours during the night. I referred her to [**NAME**] which has a loaner pump program ,I gave her a manual pump until she can get an electric pump. Mom made aware to bring her pumping kit to the NICU when she comes to see her baby. Mom encouraged to call our office if she has any concerns.
