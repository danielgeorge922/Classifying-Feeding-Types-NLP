Bp has become increasingly elevated. Antihypertensive agent- procardia xl 30 mg today as well as IV coverage (seems to become bradycardic with b blocker), has been given hydralazine which she has responded to. Denies headache or visual changes. Lungs are clear and there is nl s1 and s2 and no gallop. Will attempt conservative management with increasing procardia dosing and adding oral hydralazine. Transaminases increased yesterday, normal today. Goal is for bp in 140-150/80-90 range, currently should be on 60 mg procardia xl daily + hydralazine 25 mg q 6 - 8hour. Begin magnesium sulfate and head toward delivery for significant maternal symptoms, uncontrolled bp, markedly abnormal labs, fetal distress. Attempt fetal monitoring 20 - 30 min q 6 hours.
