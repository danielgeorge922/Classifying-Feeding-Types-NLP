Anesthesia Note.  25 yo female G1P0 on active labor, requested epidural for labor analgesia. Epidural placement performed in standard fashion, LOR @ 6cm, no CSF obtained initially, however with advancement of epidural catheter and during administration of test dose, a small amount of fluid was aspirated. I administered 2cc of lidocaine 2% with epinephrine 5mcg/mL, with relatively fast onset of numbness and motor block. Dr. [**NAME**] (AOD) notified of intrathecal catheter. CSF was aspirated from the catheter, confirming it was indeed intrathecal. VS remained stable, and no bolus dose was given. Pt is comfortable, catheter has been labeled with pink "continuous spinal" labels, nursing staff has been notified, and spinal infusion is being held until block from intrathecal lidocaine begins to resolve.  Plan: - Monitor patient closely. Since only lidocaine was given, expect block to start to wear within an hour.  - Nursing staff aware of catheter being intrathecal and infusion not running until block is less dense. - Will administer cosyntropin 1mg after delivery to decrease risk of PDPHA. - Patient was explained about continuous spinal, she voiced understanding of the situation and agrees with therapy. - Catheter to be pulled by anesthesia provider after delivery. - Call anesthesia if there is need for further analgesia.
