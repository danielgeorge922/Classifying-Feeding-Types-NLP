Social work met briefly with patient, who requested sign language interpreter. Patient advised that she does not require an interpreter immediately and is comfortable with waiting until the moring. Social work advised that an interpreter could come during physician rounds tomorrow morning and Sunday morning. Social work contacted Center for Independent Living and arranged for sign language interpreter to assist MOB on unit from 10:30-12:30 tomorrow ([**DATE**]) and Sunday ([**DATE**]). If MOB is discharged prior to Sunday, please cancel interpreter services through Center for Independent Living: [**CONTACT_PHONE**].
