Please see previous social work services progress notes for continuity.  Social work immediately responded to MOB's room due to loud, escalating, and angry behavior.  MOB was observed by social work screaming and hitting FOB in the presence of an older child.  MOB was also throwing and object that appeared to be a cell phone.  Floor nurses and charge nurse responded immediately and notified security.  Infant and older child were removed from the room for safety.  MOB could not be redirected and continued to escalate and scream at FOB until security asked FOB to the leave the unit.  Once FOB left the unit and MOB calmed down, older child returned to the room.  Older child reports she contacted maternal grandmother to be picked up immediately.    Social work contacted current DCF protective investigator [**NAME**] and reported the domestic violence incident.  DCF presented later to bedside and met with MOB.  There are no visitation restrictions as this time.  If FOB presents to visit newborn, he may do so in the nursery or a place separate from MOB.  Please contact social work prior to newborn discharge, as discharge plans are unknown at this time.
