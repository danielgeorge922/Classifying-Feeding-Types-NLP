She had eaten 4 hours prior.  She had a suspicious category II FHT with minimal to moderate variability, no accels and decelerations with ctxs thus we proceeded with emergent status.  Procedure: After satisfactory anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped in a routine fashion for abdominal surgery.  Time-out confirmed patient and procedure.  The abdomen was entered with a Pfannenstiel approach.  A bladder flap was created and then a transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and extended laterally with the surgeon's fingers.  Amniotic fluid was meconium stained.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation with the aid of a vacuum.  The cord was clamped and cut and the baby handed to the pediatrician.  Blood for gases and DNA was obtained.  The placenta was delivered with cord traction.  The uterus was wiped out with a lap.  The uterus was closed in a double layer closure using 0-vicryl.  The peritoneum and muscle layers were re-approximated with 2-0 vicryl.  The fascia was closed with 2 suture/s of 0-Vicryl starting at the angle and running in a continuous fashion. The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated an interrupted suture was placed.  The skin was closed with a subcuticular stitch of 4-0 polysorb.  Dermabond was applied.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.   KDavidsonMD
