Pt assumed to my care at change of shift. C/o frontal HA [**DATE**] and medicated with Fioricet x2. 24 hour urine continues until 1350 this afternoon. Assessment positive for HA, +3 edema to LE and some puffiness to hands though pt states it is less than before. I reiterated the need to rest in bed when not up to bathroom.
