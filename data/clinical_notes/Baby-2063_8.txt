ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  600 mL.  DRAINS:  Foley.  CONDITION:  Stable.  FINDINGS:  Old skin incision with normal uterus, tubes and ovaries.  Low transverse cesarean incision made on the uterus without extensions. Viable female, with Apgars of 8 and 9, weight of 2771 grams.  DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  The patient was seen in the Preoperative Holding Area.  Informed consent was reviewed.  History and physical was confirmed.  The patient was brought to the Operating Room and placed supine on the operating table with spinal anesthesia in place.  She was prepped and draped with an indwelling Foley.  A time-out procedure was observed confirming patient, position and procedure as well as special equipment.  A Pfannenstiel incision was made excising the old scar and carried down through the subcutaneous tissue through the fascia and into the peritoneum.  Upon entering the peritoneum, the bladder flap was developed and a transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment and extended with blunt dissection.  An amniotomy was performed.  Clear fluid was identified.  The infant was in the occiput posterior position.  The infant was delivered with assistance of the physician's hand.  The oropharynx was suctioned, nares were suctioned, the cord was clamped, and the baby was then passed to the NICU Team where a blood sample was obtained.  The placenta was then delivered spontaneously.  The uterus then curetted with a moist lap sponge.  The uterus was then closed in a running locked fashion using 0-Monocryl.  A second layer of 0-Monocryl was used to imbricate the primary layer. With hemostasis well controlled, the needle, instrument, and sponge counts correct, the uterus was returned to the abdominal cavity.  The peritoneum was then closed in a running fashion using 2-0 Vicryl.  The rectus muscles were approximated in the midline using 2-0 Vicryl.  The fascia was closed starting at the angles and meeting in the midline using 0-Vicryl used in an interrupted fashion to reinforce the primary layers.  The fatty tissues were approximated with 3-0 plain Vicryl.  The skin was closed with 3-0 Prolene on a Keith needle.  Steri-Strips were then placed over the wound, ABD and paper tape were then used.  The patient was brought from the Operating Room to the recovery room in stable condition.    [**NAME**], MD  [**NAME**]/MedQ DD:  [**DATE**] 11:39 DT:  [**DATE**] 16:05 Job #:  [**ID**]/[**ID**]
