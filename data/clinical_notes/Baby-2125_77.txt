Pt has progressed to 5-6 cm but after restarting Magnesium is contracting less Indications for cesarean re-reviewed: Pt had h/o HSV, last lesions were "years ago", but she reported some perineal tingling that she says was NOT characteristic of a her prodrome the morning after admission, thus acyclovir was started.  Her symptoms have not progressed and no lesions have occurred.  The recommendation from MFM was for cesarean delivery for PTL to avoid the risk of neonatal HSV transmission.  Because we want to avoid iatrogenically earlier delivery via cesarean in attempts to avoid SVD, it seemed appropriate to reconsider our concern for neonatal transmission in the setting of atypical possible prodromal symptoms of recurrent herpes lesions with no active lesions s/p 3 days of acyclovir.  Drs. Duff and Egerman confirmed their recommendation for cesarean delivery for further PTD.  Dr. [**NAME**] offered 7cm as an example of an unstable cervical exam at which point we could proceed with cesarean without much concern that we were giving up further gestational age.  Dr. [**NAME**] thought that after 5-7 days of acyclovir without emergence of leions, the prodrome could be considered treated to the point that vaginal delivery could be reconsidered.  KDavidsonMD
