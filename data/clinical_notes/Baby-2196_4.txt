JP drain in subcutaneous space  Implants (include size & make): none  Specimens: Placenta;   2. Old scar (ciatrix)   Findings:  Uterus adhered to the anterior abdominal wall   2.old scar   Complications: The patient tolerated the procedure well with no complications.  Disposition: stable  Operative Report and Findings: The patient was taken to the operating room and there under Spinal anesthesia her abdomen was draped and prepped in the usual sterile fashion.  A Mildline incision was made around the previous old scar and the  Old scar was removed with sharp dissection.  The various anatomical layers were then dissected down to the layer of the parietal peritoneum.The parietal peritoneum was entered with aid of hemostats and Metzenbaum scissors. The uterus was adhered to the anterior abdominal wall and had to be resected with sharp and blunt dissection.  Once the uterus was freed from the anterior wall a  bladder flap was established with aid of Metzenbaum scissors.  A transverse incision was made on the lower uterine segment and spread with blunt finger dissection.  A viable male infant was delivered  and handed to the NICU unit on standby.  The placenta was manually removed and the uterus was closed with a continuous interlocking layer of 0-PDS suture.  The uterine incision was then reinforced with a second continuous imbricating layer of 0-PDS.  The parietal peritoneum was then closed with a continuous layer of 000-vicryl.    The fascia was closed with a continuous layer of 0-PDS starting a suture from both corners of the incision.  The fascia was reinforced with 3 smeed-jones type interupted sutures at the mid, upper and lower part of the longtutional incision.  The subcutaneous layer was closed with a continuous layer of 000-vicryl. The skin was closed with a subcuticular stitch of 0000-proline suture.  The incision was covered with a Derma bond dressing.  The patient tolerated the procedure well under spinal anesthesia.  She was taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  Operative note dictated by: [**NAME**] [**DATE**] 1:03 PM
