R2 Note In to see pt. Answered pt's questions regarding timing and mode of delivery. I explained that we would wait for an MFM to decide official timing of delivery. The pt will continue to monitor her bleeding and let us know if she has more than spotting or is she begins contracting/cramping. Currently the pt is comfortable and complains only of spotting. We will CTM closely. The pt is difficult to monitor secondary to moving in the bed frequently, the importance of monitoring was explained to the pt. Overall the tracing is reassuring when the baby is monitored with accels.  [**NAME**], MD
