Mom is engorged and bottle fed last night. Mom is both bottle feeding and breastfeeding.,she uses a nipple shield to breast feed. The baby would not stay latched on without the nipple shield. The nipple appeared pinched when the baby latched with out the nipple shield.mom made aware that the baby chomps when he first latches on and that the baby's tongue appears to have a tight frenulum. Mom states she will work with the baby ;she is not interested in a possible frenotomy. I made MD Knickerbocker aware. Mom instructed to breastfeed every [**DATE**] to 2 hours and to pump 10 minutes after breast feeding and to apply Ice pack to the breast after pumping. Mom encouraged to call the office.
