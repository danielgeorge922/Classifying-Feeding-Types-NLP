R2 Note:  NST non reactive in the first 40 minutes.  There was also a late deceleration after one contraction.  Baseline is 130s, Min-Mod BTBV, +accels after 40 minutes, +decel resolving in 1 minutes decreasing 20 beats below baseline.  Patient was kept on the monitor for at least 2 additional hours and FHT was reassuring but at times not reactive.  No further decelerations noted throughout monitoring.    A BPP was one and was 8/8; however, AFI was 6 cm.  Given that patient is dated by a 21 week sono that agrees with LMP, has had a nonreactive FHT with a deceleration and oligohydramnios, will admit for induction of labor.  Cervix checked, FT/50/-3/mid/int.  Cephalic confirmed by ultrasound.   Bishops = 3   Will proceed with misoprostol induction of labor.    [**NAME**] MD
