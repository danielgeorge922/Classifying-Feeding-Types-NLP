I received a consult from bedside RN, because MOB is homeless.  I met with [**NAME**], age 34 today in her room in private.  This is her first child. She does not have a telephone.  She stated that she has been residing in tent city.  She has two friends watching her possessions.  Father of baby is [**NAME**], who is homeless and resides in [**LOCATION_CITY**], Florida.  She had attempted to obtain lodging at the Arbor House.   She did not have her birth certificate and has reapplied for one through Holy Trinity.  She requested that she be able to lodge at the [**NAME**] House.  I informed her that the [**NAME**] House does not allow [**LOCATION_CITY**] County residents to lodge there, but I will tell them her circumstances and determine if it is possible.  I telephoned [**NAME**] the manager at the [**NAME**], but she will not allow her to lodge there.   Ms. [**NAME**] was admitted to the emergency room on [**DATE**] because she had been raped during the middle of the night.  Ms. [**NAME**] stated that she completed High School with a special education diploma.  She has work experience and was employed at [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] in dietary for 2 1/2 years.  She has worked at Quiznos and other places as a cashier.  I met the maternal grandparents, [**NAME**] and [**NAME**], [**CONTACT_PHONE**],  who seem very nice.  Ms. [**NAME**] told Ms. [**NAME**] that she wants her to lodge with her family in [**LOCATION_CITY**] and she will transport her to [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] daily on her way to and from work.  I will plan to meet with maternal grandparents in private to determine if they have any concerns about Ms. [**NAME**]'s ability to bond appropriately and her ability to provide care for patient.  Ms. [**NAME**] denied any mental health diagnosis, and has not applied for SSI.  I will continue to assess whether or not to involve DCF.  If Ms. [**NAME**] continues to be homeless I will make a report to DCF close to discharge.
