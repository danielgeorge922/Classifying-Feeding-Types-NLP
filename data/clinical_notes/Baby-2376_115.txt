ATTENDING OP NOTE  Date of Surgery: [**DATE**]  Preoperative Diagnosis: 1.  IUP at 32 weeks 2.  Severe pre-eclampsia 3.  Failed induction  Postoperative Diagnosis: Same  Operation Performed: Low transverse cesarean   Surgeon: [**NAME**]  Assistant: [**NAME**]/[**NAME**]/[**NAME**] (MS1)  Anesthesiologist [**NAME**]  Anesthesia: **   Procedure:   Prior to the start of surgery, a time-out was taken, and the patient's identity and operative procedure were verified.  The peritoneal cavity then was entered without complication through a  Pfannensteil incision.  The lower uterine segment was identified, and the bladder flap was created by sharp and blunt dissection.  A horizontal incision was made in the lower uterine segment, and the infant was delivered from a cephalic presentation without difficulty.  The baby was a  3 pound, 2 ounce female and had Apgar scores of 9 and 10 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively.  The arterial and venous cord blood gases are pending at this time. The placenta was removed by gentle traction on the umbilical cord.  It was intact, and the cord had 3 vessels.  The myometrium then was closed in two layers using continuous sutures of 0-Vicryl.  The pericolic gutters were carefully irrigated.  The fascial edges then were re-approximated with two continuous sutures of 0-Vicryl.  The wound was  irrigated, and the lower half of the subcutaneous tissue was re-approximated with a running suture of 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin edges were re-approximated with an intracuticular suture of 3-0 Monocryl.  The estimated blood loss during surgery was 800 ml, and the patient received 700 ml of lactated ringer's solution.  At the conclusion of the procedure, the sponge count and needle count were correct.  The neonate was transported to the newborn nursery in good condition, and the mother was transported to the recovery room, also in good condition.  The patient received an injection of cefazolin plus azithromycin to reduce the risk of postoperative infection.  [**NAME**], M.D. Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology
