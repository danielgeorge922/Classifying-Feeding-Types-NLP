Pt assessed.  Caring for baby well.  Pt is pain free at the moment, but has been having considerable uterine cramping pain. Listening to her describe it, sounds like afterpains, very strong.  Will medicate as needed.  Encouraged her to use the K-Pad, and to have warm shower water beat on her back.  Both she has done., she says.
