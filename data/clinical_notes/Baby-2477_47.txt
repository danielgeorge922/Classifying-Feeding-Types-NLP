The decision was made to deliver via cesarean due to fetal intolerance of labor and development of chorioamnionitis.   Procedure: After satisfactory anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped in a routine fashion for abdominal surgery.  Time-out confirmed patient and procedure.  The abdomen was entered with a Pfannenstiel approach.  A bladder flap was not created and then a transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and extended laterally with Mayo Scissors.  Amniotic fluid was clear.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation.  The cord was clamped and cut and the baby handed to the pediatrician.  Blood for gases and DNA was obtained.  The placenta was delivered with cord traction.  The uterus was wiped out with a lap.  The uterus was closed in a double layer closure using 0 vicryl.  The fascia was closed with 1 suture/s of 0-Vicryl starting at the angle and running in a continuous fashion. The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and re-approximated.  The skin was closed with 4-0 monocryl.  Steristrips were applied.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.
