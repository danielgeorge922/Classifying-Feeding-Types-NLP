Discussed patient with Dr. [**NAME**] and Dr. [**NAME**].  Dr. [**NAME**] evaluated patient.  Patient drops oxygen saturation to 90% when removing oxygen.  She is now requiring to sit up in bed and keep oxygen mask at 10L to maintain saturation at 98%.  Resp rate 36, pulse 109, BP 132/85.  Patient just returned from radiology for CXR and LE dopplers.  We had previously called radiology to get CT PE protocol however, they requested to start with CXR and dopplers.  Given worse clinical picture, called again and will order CT PE protocol STAT.  Per radiology, preliminary read of CXR shows interstitial edema, unknown cause.  LE dopplers are negative.  We have ordered heparin gtt, full intensity drip given high clinical suspicion for PE.  Although patient has been a smoker for 20 years and likely has inherent lung disease, her complaint of acute onset SOB with increased hypercoagulable state of pregnancy, will continue to have high suspicion for PE.    Calculated A-a gradient is very high at 236.  WBC still pending, CBC otherwise WNL.  BMP normal, anion gap = 10 (WNL).  Glucose 100.  Will order cardiac enzymes and BNP.  Will have low threshold to discuss with ICU if clinical picture does not improve.   Dr. [**NAME**] in to discuss plan for CT scan and risks.  Following this, patient will go to CT with two RN's and oxygen.    [**NAME**] MD
