Late note:  To bedside for variable decelerations with contractions.  Progress Note:   Subjective: Patient c/o urge to defecate.     Objective:   FHT:140s, moderateBTBV, positive accels, positive variable decels TOCO: Q 2-3 min CVX: [**DATE**]  Assessment: IUP at 38w0d, IDDM, IOL for poor glucose control. Patient repositioned to far left side with improvement in variable decelerations, started on oxygen.  Will not AROM and place IUPC at this time as her induction has the potential to take quite a bit of time and I am concerned for the risk of chorioamnionitis for prolonged induction with IUPC in place.  Plan:  1. CEFMx2 2. Continue pitocin- currently @12
