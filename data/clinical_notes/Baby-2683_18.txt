Mom was breastfeeding during lactation rounds, the baby had a good latch and I help mom with the position and instructed her to make sure the baby has both the nipple and part of the areola in her mouth. However when the baby came off the breast the nipple appeared pinched,but denies any pain. Mom instructed to make us aware if the she begins to get sore and let the pediatrician know. Hunger cues taught and mom instructed to breastfeed every 1 1/2 to 2 hours and allow the baby to stay on the breast as long as she is suckling.
