Mom was breastfeeding during lactation rounds and the baby had a good latch and a nutritive suck, I also taught mom the football hold and we latched the baby to the left breast which was he breast the baby was fussing with. Every time the baby came off the breast the nipple was mis- shapened. The nipple had a pinched appearance. I made MD [**NAME**] was told.
