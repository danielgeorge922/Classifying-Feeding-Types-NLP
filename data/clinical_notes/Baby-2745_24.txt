Please see previous social work service notes for continuity. Social work received voicemail message from MOB's father, Mr. [**NAME**], inquiring how MOB and babies are doing and when newborns are expected to be d/c. Spoke with MOB, who asked me to let Mr. [**NAME**] know that she is doing well and that DCF will getting in touch with him re: placement. Social work called Mr. [**NAME**] to relay information for MOB. Also advised that newborns are likely to be d/c tomorrow or Monday. Social work will remain available to assist with safe newborn d/c.
