Pt sleeping in bed with infant. Pt given education re: infant safety and dangers of co-sleeping. I asked to place infant in crib and pt refused. States that the infant will wake up and she would rather keep the infant in the bed with her. Pt would like to defer assessment at this time due to sleeping.
