Received pt from day shift nurse. Pt is here for an induction due to uncontrolled DM2. Family at bedside. Pt has D5LR at 125, insulin at 2 units and pitocin at 16 mu/min. Pt describes pain as a "5" out of "10" and would like IV drug therapy later. Pt is spanish speaking but family member is able to translate somewhat. TOCO readjusted to better pick up contractions. Pt states that she is contracting every 5 minutes. Will discuss increasing the pitocin with Dr. [**NAME**]. Will continue to monitor pt.
