Mom states she is breastfeeding every 3 hours and the baby stays on the breast for approximately 15- 20 minutes. The baby was rooting during lactation rounds.I helped mom latch the baby onto the breast in a football hold , while I was latching the baby onto the breast I noticed baby had a tight frenulum and mom's nipple are red and cracked. The baby had a deep latch and a nutritive suck. Mom instructed to breastfeed the baby every 1 1/2 to 2 hours and allow her to stay on the breast as long as she is sucking and I taught mom how to do compression while the baby is on the breast.I made MD knickerbocker aware of the tongue ,and the baby had a frenotomy done.
