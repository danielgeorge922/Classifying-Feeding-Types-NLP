Spent approximately 20 minutes talking with mom about prematurity, the NICU, and the protocol for delivery.  Discussed length of stay, resuscitation, respiratory, feeding, and infection issues.  Encouraged mom to pump breast milk after delivery, and she seemed optimistic about the idea.  Will attend delivery; can re-update mom if delivery plans appear more imminent.
