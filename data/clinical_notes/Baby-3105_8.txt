The lower uterine segment noted to be very thin but closed adequately and hemostatic.   The right tube was identified by the fimbria and clamped with babcock.  A loop of tube was made with plain gut suture x 2.  A segment of the tube was grasped bilaterally and cut within the loop and tied with plain gut.  Hemostasis confirmed. The fascia was closed with 2 suture/s of 0-Vicryl starting at the angle and running in a continuous fashion. The subcutaneous tissue was confirmed hemostatic.  The skin was closed with 3-o monocryl.
