I spoke with the dietician regarding patient's diet.  I discussed that patient does not understand that she needs to eat regardless of what is on her tray and if she does not like her food she will not eat.  Dr. [**NAME**] and I have talked with the patient stating that she may have an extra carb for her meals if that will allow her to eat her meal.  I informed the dietician of this and she states she will talk to the nutrition supervisor to make her meals more appetizing for her.  [**NAME**], MD  I saw and evaluated the patient on the day of service. I discussed this patient with the resident and agree with the findings and plan as documented in the resident's note-  Attempting glycemic control with split mix regimen at this time
