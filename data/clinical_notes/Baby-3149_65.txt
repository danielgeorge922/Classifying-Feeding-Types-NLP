Please see previous social work services progress notes for continuity.  Social work met at length with MOB to discuss her concerns and plans re: FOB/spouse.  MOB presents with obvious distress, but reports she has developed a safety plan as well as arranged for support to be available to provide assistance now that FOB does not have plans to be involved.  Social work will involve appropriate community agencies at discharge and MOB is aware of plan.  Infant may be discharged to MOB when medically cleared, however please contact social work at discharge.
