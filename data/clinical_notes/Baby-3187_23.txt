Mom has been breastfeeding on demand;however her left nipple has a crack at the top of the nipple. The baby had a nice deep latch and a nutritive suck. Mom did complain of some discomfort. When the baby came off the breast, the nipple was mis-shapened. The baby was able to bring his tongue over the bottom ridge. MD knickerbocker made aware and the baby had a frenotomy. I gave mom a manual pump with instructions on how to use it and a clean it. Mom's right breast felt full and slightly knotty . She pumped that breast and got out about an ounce and half. Mom made aware on how to store the milk and when to supplement if it is needed, because of the ABO incompatibility.d/c instructions given.
