To room to discuss plan of care with Dr. [**NAME**], nursing and myself.  Patient questioning misoprostol and pitocin induction stating her last induction was faster.   She has previously had an uncomplicated induction of labor at 37 weeks for GHTN from an unfavorable cervix requiring miso. At that time she needed only two doses of miso so was wondering why she needed 4 doses now.  Patient currently being induced for pre eclampsia.  Pressures have been mild range, UOP adequate, DTR 2+ bilaterally.  Patient asymptomatic.    Discussed reassuring cervical change with misoprostol x 4 and the fact that she is progressing as expected.   The next step is to start pitocin.  If she does not make progress, will reassess and discuss.  Discussed the fact that SVD better for her and promotion of healing and recovery.  The fact that she has had one vaginal delivery before (of a larger baby) after induction from an unfavorable cervix is very reassuring and makes it more likely she will have a successful induction now.   Patient currently doing well at [**DATE**].  Patient and FOB agree to start pitocin to continue induction at this time. All questions answered.  [**NAME**]   I provided direct supervision for this service and was on the premises at the time of the service.  I met with the patient and her husband and had the above-documented discussion.  I reviewed the resident's note, made changes, and agree with their assessment and plan of management.
