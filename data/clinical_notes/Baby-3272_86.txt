Mom has been giving the baby more than breastfeeding,but she states she really wants to breastfeed. Mom made aware of the risk of decreased milk supply as she continues to give more bottles. Mom instructed to place the baby skin to skin and follow the baby's hunger cues and allow the baby to stay on the breast until the baby stops suckling. I helped mom latch the baby onto both breast,but he only latched onto the right breast for about 25 minutes.the baby had a good latch and a nutritive suck. Mom's left nipple is slightly inverted;the baby was not interested in breastfeeding even with the nipple shield. I started mom pumping . She was instructed to pump after breast feed. The baby was very jittery while we were trying to latch the baby onto the breast. The baby stays in a fetal position no matter how he is position. Once the baby was latched and got into a rhythm of sucking he stopped the jittering in his arms. Mom will pump using a double set and will receive a manual pump upon discharge.
