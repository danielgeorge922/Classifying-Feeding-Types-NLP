I have reviewed the medical chart.  MOB is 34 years old and this is her fourth child.  Patient was born at 32 weeks gestation weighing 2133 grams. Family resides in [**LOCATION_CITY**].  There are no social concerns noted in the medical records.  I met with MOB briefly and she denied any needs or concerns at this time.  I will complete a social assessment as soon as possible.
