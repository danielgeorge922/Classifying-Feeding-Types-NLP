Patient sent from MBU because she reported bleeding noted on pad. Per nursing it appeared to be pink tinged fluid. She was transferred to triage. On SSE cervix remains closed and thick in appears with cerclage in place approximately 2 cm proximal to the os. There is pink fluid coming from the os but no overt bleeding seen. The patient appears to be contracting approximately every 10 minutes. The FHT is currently baseline 170s, moderate BTBV, positive accels, when the pateint was first put on the monitor the FHT was in the 80's c/w a variable decel. The maternal HR is in the 120s. Her temp was 37.4. She has no fundal tenderness.   Assessment:  1. PPROM at 20 weeks, now 24w5d 2. Vaginal bleeding- concern for possible abruption 3. Fetal and maternal tachycardia- certainly chorioamnionitis is on the differential at this point in time but as she has no maternal fever and no fundal tenderness will continue to monitor for overt evidence of chorioamnionitis. If the patient is confirmed to have chorio will proceed with cesarean delivery. Will need to be sure at this point given the implications of a 24 week delivery.   Plan:  Transfer to L&D Ultrasound performed- breech presentation. EFW: 523g, 5%. Anhydramnios noted. Placenta anterior.  Consents for cesarean including classical confirmed to be on the chart.  Will start magnesium for neuroprotection  She is s/p steroids on [**DATE**].  Peds aware If she develops fever, worsening bleeding or tracing concerns will order Abx and proceed with cesarean.
