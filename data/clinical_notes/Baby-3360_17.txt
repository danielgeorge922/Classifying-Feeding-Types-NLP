Called regarding patient well known to the neurosurgery service.  Ms. [**NAME**] is a very pleasant 25 yo female with known posterior cervical hemangioma. Patient is currently in her 3rd trimester of pregnancy. She remains asymptomatic at rest. On exam she has symmetric motor exam with 5/5 strength and intact sensation. However upon valsalva patient develops symptoms of bilateral lower extremity numbness and posterior lumbar spine and lower extremity paresthesias consistent with Lhermitte's phenomenon. Because of the onset of the symptoms with minimal straining, this suggests that normal child labor would increase risk of spinal cord injury when compared to a cesarean section.   Discussed with patient and primary team. Will discuss risks of both to the patient. In either case would strongly recommend avoiding hypotension during delivery and perform physical/neurologic exam after delivery.   IF patient does develop any symptoms that persist please notify neurosurgery on call emergently.    Discussed with on call neurosurgery attend Dr. [**NAME**] and attending spine surgeon Dr. [**NAME**]
