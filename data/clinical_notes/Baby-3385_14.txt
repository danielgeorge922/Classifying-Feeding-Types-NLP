Mom was pumping when I did the consult, and flange was not centered most of her areola on the side of the flange. I stopped her pumping and centered the nipple and changed her left flange to a 30 mm. Mom did get drops of colostrum and I applied it to her nipples and areola. Mom was taught how to clean and put the pump together. Written and verbal pumping instructions given.  Hand expression was taught and encouraged.
