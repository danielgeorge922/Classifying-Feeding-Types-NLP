Liveborn infant male weighing 3648 grams with Apgars of 9 and 9.  Indication: [**NAME**] is a 38 y.o. female para 1011 who presents for scheduled repeat cesarean section at 38 weeks.   Procedure: After satisfactory anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped in a routine fashion for abdominal surgery.  Time-out confirmed patient and procedure.  The abdomen was entered with a Pfannensteil approach.  A bladder flap was created and then a transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and extended laterally with the surgeon's fingers.  Amniotic fluid was clear.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation.  The cord was clamped and cut and the baby handed to the pediatrician.  Blood for gases and DNA was obtained.  The placenta was delivered with cord traction.  The uterus was wiped out with a lap.  The uterus was closed in a single layer closure using 0-vicryl. The angles of the hysterotomy were secured with figure-of-eight stitches and then one stitch was ran across the incision in a running fashion.    The right fallopian tube was identified by the fimbria, double ligated with 0-chromic suture and the intervening segment excised.  The left fallopian tube was identified by the fimbria, double ligated with 0-chromic suture and the intervening segment excised.     The fascia was closed with 2 sutures of 0-Vicryl starting at the angle and running in a continuous fashion to meet in midline. The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and approximated with a running stitch of 3-0 vicryl.  The skin was closed with staples.  A sterile dressing was applied.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.  [**NAME**]  Dictated for: [**NAME**]
