I met with the patient and reviewed her history. She has GDM diet controlled, is 40 weeks, and has suspected macrosomia with EFW 4161g ( 87%ile).  She has been counseled several times previously, including today by Dr. [**NAME**] and earlier today by Dr. [**NAME**].  She and her family understand the concerns we have for size of this baby and shoulder dystocia. She understands potential risks of dystocia, including maternal and fetal trauma, nerve injury, bone injury, soft tissue injury.  They still desire to proceed with SVD.  She has has a normal active phase and normal second stage. She has been complete since around 6am but was allowed to passively descend until around 9am. She started pushing around 9:15am.  We reviewed dystocia maneuvers.  She is currently ready to deliver.
