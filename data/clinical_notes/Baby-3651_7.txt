Date of Surgery:  [**DATE**]  Preoperative Diagnosis: 39 week intrauterine pregnancy, Prior cesarean delivery x 2, Undesired fertility, Morbid obestity  Postoperative Diagnosis: Same  Operation Performed: Repeat low cesarean section, Bilateral Parkland Tubal Interruption  Surgeon: [**NAME**]  Assisstant: [**NAME**]  Anesthesia: [**NAME**]  Anesthesia type:  Combined spinal  Pathology: bilateral segments of tube  EBL: 1000 ml  IVF:  2200ml  Findings: Normal uterus, tubes and ovaries bilaterally.  Liveborn infant female weighing 3998 gram with Apgars of 7 and 9.  Indication: [**NAME**] is a 34 y.o. female para 1103 who was admitted for repeat cesarean delivery due to history of 2 prior cesareans and bilateral tubal interruption for undesired fertility.  Procedure: After satisfactory anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped in a routine fashion for abdominal surgery.  Time-out confirmed patient and procedure.  The abdomen was entered with a vertical midline approach.  A bladder flap was created and then a transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and extended laterally with the surgeon's fingers.  Amniotic fluid was clear.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation via vacuum assistance with Kiwi vacuum.  One pull with no pop-offs.  The cord was clamped and cut and the baby handed to the pediatrician.  Blood for gases and DNA was obtained.  The placenta was delivered with cord traction followed by manual extraction due to cord avulsion.  The uterus was wiped out with a lap.  The uterus was closed in a double layer closure using 0-monocryl for the 1st layer and 0-vicryl for the imbricating layer.    The right fallopian tube was identified by the fimbria, double ligated with 0-chromic suture and the intervening segment excised.  The left fallopian tube was identified by the fimbria, double ligated with 0-chromic suture and the intervening segment excised.    There was bleeding noted on the posterior aspect of the muscle along the peritoneum on the left side and in the inferior apex. This was corrected with cautery and a single 3-0 vicryl stitch in a figure of 8 fashion in the inferior apex behind the muscle.  Arista was placed for prophylaxis.   The fascia was closed with 2 suture/s of 0-PDS starting at the angle and running in a continuous fashion. The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated with saline and closed in multiple layers of 2-0 vicryl.  The skin was closed with staples.  Bandage was applied.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.  [**NAME**], MD
