Pt asleep when I entered the room and aroused after calling her name and moving her leg. Appears rather groggy. States her back pain is 9/10. Pt's speech difficult to understand. States that she will need Ativan so that she can calm down. Pt fell back to sleep very quickly after taking her medications for the morning. Call light within reach. Will continue to monitor pt.
