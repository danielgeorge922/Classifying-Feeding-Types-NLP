At bedside to discuss current plan of care and patient's frustrations with her and her mother via telephone.  Reiterated that we and rheumatology do not believe based on the character of her pain, that it is secondary to RA, but is likely musculoskeletal in nature.  Per discussion with Dr. [**NAME**] this morning, we will not continue prednisone for additional course, and have recommended Flexeril, heat, and PT consult tomorrow AM.  Additionally, patient reports multiple social stressors at home which are preventing her from feeling like she can stay in the hospital.  I strongly recommended that we obtain a social work consult as there are multiple resources available to help people with unexpected hospital stays.  Patient stated that she didn't think there was anything they could do to help, but stated she would be ok talking to a social worker.  Patient's IV infiltrated.  As BPs are currently within mild range, will not replace at this time per her request.  She verbalizes understanding that IV will need to be replaced if bp increases and there is need for IV antihypertensive medication.  Patient agrees to try flexeril, tylenol, and heating pad now.  Physical therapy and social work consults placed.  [**NAME**]
