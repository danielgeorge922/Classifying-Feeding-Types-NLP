SW met with pt and her mother to answer questions about discharge.  Nurse ([**NAME**]) was concerned that pt did not understand that she was not going to the [**NAME**] House today because she is still on the waiting list.  SW spoke with mother of pt who reported that she understood that she was still on the waiting list and has a hotel room until Monday.  Mother of pt reported that she was concerned about having a room at [**NAME**] by Monday.  SW explained that the best she can do is to call each day to keep her name on the list.  Mother of pt also had a few other (non-emergent) questions that MBU SW felt would be best answered by NICU SW on Monday.    SW will continue to follow.
