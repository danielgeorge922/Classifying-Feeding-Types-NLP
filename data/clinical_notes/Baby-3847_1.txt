Spoke with Dr [**NAME**], told him strip is not reactive, pt having questionable lates and variables on FHR strip. Told him she has had several with each ctx. Overall the strip has mod varability with accels. He states he wants to order a prolonged OCT. Start pitocin and increase until adequate ctxs (3:10 min).  Told him pt has had that already, he however wants to start pitocin because he wants it prolonged. He requested I write a verbal order since he is not at a computer to put orders in at this time.
