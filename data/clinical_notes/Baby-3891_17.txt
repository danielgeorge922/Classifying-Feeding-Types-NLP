Pt admit via bed from L&D to 9528. Oriented to room.  Pt requested help with breast feeding upon arrival.  Pt asked to wait on O2 sat monitor and q 1 hour vitals awaiting new orders to discontinue.  Pt was focused on breast feeding help so assessment was deferred at this time.  Good latch and suck on the right breast few sucks on left breast.
