Mom states the baby has not breast fed for 6 hours :mom is having difficulty waking the baby up. I woke the baby up and assessed the baby's tongue because of the trauma noted on the nipples.the baby has tight frenulum, MD Knickerbocker made aware. Mom had refused the frenotomy because she was afraid of hurting the baby. She was anxious and began to cry ; mom reassured that this procedure was not  critical and I described the procedure. I helped mom latch the baby onto the breast in a football hold, the baby started out chomping then went into a rhythmic suck. Mom cried when I latched the baby onto the breast. I took the baby off and asked mom how she wanted to feed the baby,because the baby has not been fed since the early am. Mom decided to re-latch the baby and she did some breathing when she initially latched the baby onto the breast. The baby does have a good latch and a nutritive suck.
