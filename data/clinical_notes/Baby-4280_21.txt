Mom is concerned because the baby is very sleepy, she tried to bottle feed and the baby does not wake up. I assisted mom with the latch and the baby suckled very little on the left breast for about 5 minutes and licked the right breast.I gave the baby a couple of drops of colostrum via spoon and a little bit of formula via spoon , the baby also took approximately 5 mls of formula via bottle. Mom was happy that the baby had somewhat of a feeding. The Plan is for mom to pump for 15 min after feed if the baby is not awake enough to stimulate her breast. Her breast are widely spaced and slightly tubular. The baby is skin to skin. If the baby does not latch on at all give only 15 mls of formula. Breastfeeding is to be attempted first.
