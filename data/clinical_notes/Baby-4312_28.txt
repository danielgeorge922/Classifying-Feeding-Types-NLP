Was called to pts bedside by RN to evaluate pt for PDPH. After reviewing her stay, I spoke with the pt. She states her HA is located in back of the neck assoc with stiffeness there, a little pain in the front of her head, but states that the pain has been for several hours. She states the pain gets better with her PO percocet and sitting up. She could not tolerate laying flat. She has a h/o of PDPH and she states this pain is different. I discussed risk of epidural patch. She did not want this procedure. I discussed with her see can call anesthesia if her HA change or get worse and gave the phone number.
