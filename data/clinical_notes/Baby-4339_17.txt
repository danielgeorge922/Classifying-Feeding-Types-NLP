Pt requesting more percocet. After speaking to the pt she reports that her pain is vaginal and occurs when she urinates. She also feels a pressure in the vagina when sitting. She did not have a laceration. I examine the perineium and found it to be intact with only minimal edema. I examined the pt digitally and did not palpate a hematoma.  We will plan to check a urinalysis to ensure the pt does not have a UTI. Th ept had a foley catheter in labor and I explained to the pt that this may be causing her discomfort with urination. We will proved an ice pack and epifoam for perineal discomfort and continue to monitor her pain. No additional narcotics necessary at this time.  [**NAME**], MD
