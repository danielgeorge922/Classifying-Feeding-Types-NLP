ATTENDING DELIVERY NOTE AND SUBSEQUENT OP NOTE  At 0800, the patient was 70%, 3to4 cm,and -3 station.  Pitocin induction was started. At 1035, I returned to evaluate the patient.  She was sittiing upright having an epidural catheter inserted.  However, she was visibly uncomfortable and stated that she felt like she had to push.  I quickly examined her and noted that she was C/C. +3 cm  The attempt to place the epidural was discontinued..  Within 5 minutes, she spontaneously delivered a 3543 gram female with no anesthesia.  The baby had Apgar scores of [**DATE**].  The arterial cord pH was 7.26.  Although the patient had several small gushes of blood, the placenta did not separate.  Gentle traction on the cord was unsuccessful in dislodging the placenta.  The blood loss associated with the delivery itself was 300 ml.  However, the retained placenta resulted in continuing slow blood loss.  Accordingly, I quickly counseled the patient for manual removal of the placenta in the OR under general anesthesia.  She readily agreed to the procedure, but the urgency of the situation did not allow time for her to sign an operative consent form.  Dr. [**NAME**] was consulted for assistance.  OPERATIVE NOTE  Preoperative Diagnosis:  Retained (adherent) placenta  Postoperative DIagnosis:  1.  Retained (adherent)  placenta 2. Small 1.5 cm laceration at the vaginal introitus  Procedure: 1. Manual removal of the placenta 2.  Repair of perineal laceration  Surgeon:  [**NAME**]  Anesthesiologist:  [**NAME**]  Anesthesia:  Intravenous ketamine  Description of the Procedure:  Prior to the start of surgery, a time-out was taken,and the patient's identity and surgical procedure were verified.  Under ketamine anesthesia, she was placed in the dorsal lithotomy position and draped in a sterile manner.  Within 1 minute, I was able to manually remove the placenta.  I then performed a limited uterine curettage to be certain that all fragments of placenta were removed.  I then performed an abdominal ultrasound to verify that no significant amount of placental tissue remained in the uterine cavity.  From the time the adherent placenta was diagnosed until it was removed, the patient lost approximately 1000 ml of blood.  The received 1000 ml of LR solution during surgery.  She also received an injection of cefazolin, 1 gram, to reduce the risk of infection following manual removal of the placenta.  The patient was awakened from anesthesia without difficulty and transported back to her labor room in good condition.  Her blood pressure remained normal during surgery. Her pre-operative HCT was 40 vol %.  [**NAME**], M.D.
