Spoke with patient regarding our recommendations for fetal monitoring at this time.  Initially patient states, as per RN note, that she felt like only baby C needed to be monitored.  Clarified with patient that unless we are monitoring all triplets, we cannot be certain that we are monitoring fetus with AEDV.  Also clarified that given AEDV of both umbilical arteries, as well as oligohydramnios, baby is at risk for fetal distress at any time, and patient should not necessarily be reassured at this time by previous antenatal testing.  I acknowledged that continuous monitoring of triplets is very uncomfortable, but clarified that it is our recommendation at this time, and that without continuous monitoring, one or any of the triplets is at risk for fetal heart tracing abnormalities, that if detected, would be an indication for emergent cesarean delivery.  All questions answered.  Patient states that she would like to attempt continuous monitoring of all babies.  [**NAME**]
