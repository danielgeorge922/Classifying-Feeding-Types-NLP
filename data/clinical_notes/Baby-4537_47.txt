I assisted mom with latching the baby onto the breast in a football hold and the baby had a good latch and a nutritive suck. Mom instructed to breast feed every 1 1/2 to 2 hours or when she observes any of the of hunger cues I taught her. Mom was instructed to allow the baby to stay on the breast as long as the baby is sucking. Mom has WIC and referred her to the Center for Breastfeeding if she has any concerns. breastfeeding d/c instructions given.
