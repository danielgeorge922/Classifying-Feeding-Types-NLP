Pt sleeping with infant on her chest. Roused to her name but falls off to sleep easily. C/o leg pain 8/10 and asked when the Dilaudid IV was due. Scheduled Motrin given. I suggested to pt that she walk in the halls this afternoon for exercise. She did not respond to that suggestion. Pt gets OOB to bathroom only and then returns to bed. Encouragement offered to be more active so that she will be prepared for going home.
