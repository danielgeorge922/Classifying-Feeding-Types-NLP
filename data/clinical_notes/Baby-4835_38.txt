R2 Note  Received telephone call from Gastroenterology.  Given her elevated LFTs, bilirubin, and persistently elevated WBC, they have significant concern for cholangitis.  They recommend an ERCP and cholecystectomy, beginning with the ERCP tomorrow.  Reviewed all of the current information with Dr. [**NAME**] who discussed the case with Dr. [**NAME**].  The patient had severe-range pressures during the day.  Protein:Creatinine ratio returned as 4000, indicating significant proteinuria.  Panel showed increasing LFTs.  Given the new diagnosis of pre-eclampsia and concern for cholangitis in the setting of a favorable cervix, will begin induction with Pitocin at this time.  [**NAME**] MD MA
