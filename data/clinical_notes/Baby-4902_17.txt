Liveborn infant female weighing 1830 grams with Apgars of 2 and 7.  Indication: [**NAME**] is a 33 y.o. female para 2002 who presented to Triage by private car from [**LOCATION_CITY**] after she had a BPP of [**DATE**] (2 for fluid volume) completed by Dr. [**NAME**].  No NST was completed at that time.  On arrival to Triage she had a non-reassuring fetal heart rate tracing and she was taken to the OR for a cesarean section.  Procedure:  During placement of the spinal, acute fetal bradycardia required induction of general endotracheal anesthesia.  The patient was prepped and draped quickly for emergent abdominal surgery.  The abdomen was entered rapidly with a Pfannenstiel approach.  A bladder flap was not created and then a transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and extended laterally with the surgeon's fingers.  Amniotic fluid was clear.  The above described infant was delivered from the breech presentation.  The cord was clamped and cut and the baby handed to the pediatrician.  Blood for gases and DNA was obtained.  The placenta was delivered with cord traction.  The uterus was wiped out with a lap.  The uterus was closed in a double layer closure using 0-Vicryl.  An additional figure-of-eight suture of 0-Vicryl was placed for hemostasis.  The fascia was closed with 2 sutures of 0-Vicryl starting at the angles and running in a continuous fashion. The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and re-approximated with 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with 4-0 Vicryl.  Steri strips and bandage were applied.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct, the patient was extubated and left for the recovery room in good condition.   [**NAME**]  Dictated for [**NAME**]  I was present for the key portions of the procedure.  I was immediately available for the entire procedure between opening and closing.  I reviewed the resident's note and made appropriate corrections and additions to it.
