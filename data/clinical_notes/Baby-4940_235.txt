Mom is concerned with her milk supply because she is not getting the same volume at each pump.  Mom instructed that this is normal, and to continue to pump every 2 hours during the day and every 3 hours for 15 minutes. Written and verbal pumping instructions given. I also taught mom how to massage her breast and do hand expression.
