Undesired fertility.  POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  1. 39-week intrauterine pregnancy.  2. Breech presentation.  3. Oligohydramnios.  4. Undesired fertility.    5. Extensive external uterine decidual reaction.  OPERATION PERFORMED:  1. Low transverse cesarean section.  2. Bilateral tubal interruption.  SURGEON:  1. [**NAME**], MD  [**ID**]. [**NAME**], MD ASSISTANT SURGEON:  [**NAME**], MD and [**NAME**], MD  ANESTHESIOLOGIST:   ASSISTANT ANESTHESIOLOGIST:    ANESTHESIA:  Spinal and general endotracheal anesthesia.  ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  800 mL.  IV FLUIDS:  2000 mL.  PATHOLOGY:  Segments of each tube.  FINDINGS:   1.Live male newborn, weight 3210 g, Apgars 5 and 9. 2.Normal tube and ovaries. 3.Extensive external decidual reaction in the posterior side of the uterus that extended into the rectal serosa. 4.Small uterine fibroids, about 1-2 cm diameter.  DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE:  The patient was identified and brought to the Operating Room, and was placed on the operating table in dorsal supine position.  A time-out confirmed patient and procedure.  It was verified that the patient received prophylactic antibiotics and SCDs were in place.  After placement of proper spinal anesthesia, a Pfannenstiel incision was performed.  Then a low transverse incision in the uterine segment was performed with the delivery via breach of a male newborn above-described.  The placenta was delivered through cord traction.  The uterus was wiped out with a lap.  The uterus was exteriorized.  The tube was identified by its fimbriated end.  It was grasped using a Babcock clamp.  A small opening was performed on the mesosalpinx and, using 0 chromic suture, the tubes were tied.  Then the intervening segment was cut and excised bilaterally.  Hemostasis was assured.  At this time we identified the extensive decidual reaction above described in the posterior wall of the uterus.  This decidual reaction was having bleeding.  Initially it was attempted to produce hemostasis to compression.  This was not successful, so this was achieved later using cautery and figure-of-eight stitches in appropriate places.  During this period, the uterus became soft, so the patient received IM Hemabate 2 times, 250 mcg, and Methergine 0.2 mg IM as well, and later misoprostol 1000 mg per rectum.  The bleeding continued in the posterior wall of the uterus.  We applied compression using a warm wet lap for about 10 minutes.  This improved considerably the bleeding to the extent that it was minimal.  We applied Arista and on top of it Surgicel.  This controlled definitely the bleeding.  After 10 minutes, it  was verified that there was no more bleeding.  In order to return the uterus to the intra-abdominal position, it was decided to produce a small vertical extension open on the fascia as well as on the right abdominis rectus muscle.  This was performed without complications, and the uterus was replaced into the abdominal cavity.  Hemostasis was assured.  The muscle was sutured with 3-0 Vicryl.  The fascia was closed with running suture of 0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissue was closed using 3-0 Vicryl in interrupted manner, and the skin was closed using 4-0 Vicryl in a subcuticular running stitch.  At the end of the procedure, all counts were correct.  The patient was awakened from anesthesia and transferred to the Recovery Room.
