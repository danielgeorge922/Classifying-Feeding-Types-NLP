This EEG is being performed to evaluate for possible seizures.  TECHNICAL SUMMARY:  This is a prolonged 1 hour and 30 minute study performed at the patient's bedside utilizing a 21 channel digital system with the patient in the awake and drowsy states.  A standard set of electrodes were applied according to International 10-20 guidelines with dual lead EKG recording simultaneous cardiac rhythm.  In the awake state with eyes closed, the patient demonstrates a well-developed and modulated 9 to 10 Hz posterior predominant rhythm that attenuates with eye opening and drowsy transitions.  No evidence of sleep was seen on this record.  The patient was supposed to go on prolonged monitoring, however, during her  epidural the equipment was disconnected. Episodic bilateral temporoparietal delta frequency slowing is seen.  At times, associated with transitions between wakefulness and drowsiness.  No definitive epileptiform features or subclinical seizure activity was seen. The EKG appears to show tachycardia throughout.  IMPRESSION:  Prolonged video EEG remarkable for episodic bilateral temporoparietal mild slowing, likely related to the patient's  drowsiness. No evidence of definitive epileptiform features or subclinical seizure activity was seen.  The consulting team was notified of these results.  The patient was taken off of monitoring urgently to go to C-section.
