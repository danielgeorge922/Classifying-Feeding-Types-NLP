Please see previous SW notes for continuity.  SW received call from [**LOCATION_CITY**] DCF Worker [**NAME**] ([**CONTACT_PHONE**]) stating that baby, who is being sheltered by DCF, can be discharged to [**NAME**] (family member).  SW asked Ms. [**NAME**] how the discharge plan from MOB would work, as MOB stated that she would be leaving with [**NAME**].  Ms. [**NAME**] stated that in this case, MOB and baby can both go with [**NAME**], as they are going directly to court at 1pm.  SW also received a call from DCF Worker [**NAME**] ([**CONTACT_PHONE**]) confirming the discharge plan above.    SW received a fax from DCF Worker [**NAME**] which included the shelter information and placement plan for baby, which identified [**NAME**] as the placement.  SW placed a copy of these documents in baby's chart.  SW met with MOB and [**NAME**] to request that [**NAME**] provide her photo ID and sign the Receipt for Custody. SW placed a copy of Ms. [**NAME**]'s photo ID and the original signed Receipt of Custody in baby's chart.    Nurse ([**NAME**]) provided MOB and Ms. [**NAME**] with baby's discharge information.  SW has no other interventions planned at this time.  Baby can be discharged to [**NAME**].
