Vaginal delivery  SUMMARY: [**NAME**] is a 33 y.o.  female P 0-0-1-0, presenting with a 19 week intrauterine pregnancy with vaginal bleeding.  On admission she was found to be dilated to 3 centimeters with 30 percent effacement and bulging membranes.  Amniotic fluid index was 13.1 at the time.  For full history of present illness please see complete history and physical exam. She was admitted on hospital day one and was started on ampicillin and azithromycin intravenously for exposed membranes.  She was evaluated by Maternal Fetal Medicine and on hospital day three underwent an emergency MacDonald cerclage, and she was started on gentamicin and metronidazole.  For details please see the dictated operative note.  She tolerated the procedure well without incident.  She was transferred to the floor, where she remained stable until hospital day seven when she reported leaking of fluid.  Speculum exam was equivocal with a positive nitrazine but negative fern test, however ultrasound revealed new anhydramnios.  The patient was counseled regarding her options, and she decided to terminate the pregnancy.  Consents were signed and witnessed.  Her cerclage was removed and a misoprostol induction of labor was begun.  On hospital day eight she delivered a live 20 week fetus which subsequently died.  Her placenta delivered spontaneously and complete delivery was confirmed on ultrasound.  She declined autopsy or cremation.  She was ambulating, voiding spontaneously and tolerating a regular diet.  She was then discharged home in good condition.    DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: You may immediately resume your usual diet. You may take a shower or a bath, according to your preference.
