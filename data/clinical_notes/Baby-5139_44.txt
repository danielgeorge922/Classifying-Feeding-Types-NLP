Called for evaluation to MBU due to patient reporting worsening contractions. She states they are now coming every 5 minutes compared to every 10 previously and also feel stronger. Cervical exam 4/C/BB. She has previously had a consistent exam of 3/C/-2 over the past 48 hrs here. She has di/di twins at 35 weeks with malpresentation of twin B, plan for delivery by c/s. Given this change will bring patient over to triage on L&D for monitoring and 2 hr recheck. If she is progressing, will consider proceeding with c/s vs admission to labor room for continued expectant management  [**NAME**], MD
