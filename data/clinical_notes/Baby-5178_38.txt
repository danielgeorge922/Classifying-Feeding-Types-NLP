Case discussed with Dr [**NAME**]. At bedside to discuss plan of care with patient  Cervix: [**DATE**] cephalic. No hands presenting.  Dr [**NAME**] discuss with pt and husband possibility of vaginal delivery.  We explained them risk of uterine rupture of 5-7% after h/o classical C/S. They are aware and want to proceed with this plan:  Cerclage will be removed. If pt spontaneously dilates delivery will be allowed. If she does not dilate pregnancy will continue, if she continues contracting and dilates labor will be allowed. However we ill not augment.  This decision is based on fact that placenta is posterior and if there is rupture placenta will not be disrupted.  Otherwise C/S will be done under typical OB indications.  [**NAME**], MD
