Patient still in triage waiting for labor room. Came to evaluate the rash and itching she described to RN following her 6g mag bolus. At this time the itching and rash have both improved greatly; she now just has a few small patches of erythema and small raised papules on her upper arms bilaterally. She denies any shortness of breath or chest pain. Plan of care discussed with the patient. She is aware that she will stay here at this time at least for her BMS course and completion of her 24 hr urine. If she is ruled out for pre-eclampsia, BP well-controlled, glucose well-controlled, and no cervical change consistent with preterm labor magnesium can be discontinued and she may even be able to be discharged; however if pre-e is the diagnosis she may be delivered following her steroid course or in the next few weeks. Additionally I explained that with polyhydramnios amnioreduction is indicated if it is contributing to preterm labor or for significant maternal discomfort (e.g. Difficulty breathing, severe pain). All questions answered at this time.   [**NAME**], MD
