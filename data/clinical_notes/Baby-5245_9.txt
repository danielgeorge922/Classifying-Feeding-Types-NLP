Date of Surgery: [**DATE**]  Preoperative Diagnosis: 1. 35w1d IUP, 2. Dichorionic/Diamniotic Twins, 3. Opiate Dependence, 4. Labor  Postoperative Diagnosis: Same, plus 5. Adhesive disease between uterus and anterior abdominal wall  Operation Performed: 1. Repeat Low Transverse Cesarean Section, 2. Lysis of Adhesions   Surgeon: [**NAME**]  Assistant: [**NAME**]  Anesthesiologist: [**NAME**]  Anesthesiology Assistant: [**NAME**]  Anesthesia: CSE  Pathology: Placenta to pathology  EBL: 900 ml  Findings: Normal tubes and ovaries bilaterally.  Her rectus abdominis was densely adhered to the anterior rectus sheath and her omentum was adhered to both the uterine visceral peritoneum and the parietal peritoneum of the anterior abdominal wall.  Liveborn infant A, male, weighing 2059 grams with Apgars of 9 and 9.  Liveborn infant B, female, weighing 1641 grams with Apgars of 9 and 9.  Indication: [**NAME**] is a 25 y.o. female para 1202 at 35w1d with dichorionic/diamniotic twins and a prior classical cesarean delivery at 24 weeks who presented in labor.  She was then taken to the operating room for repeat cesarean delivery.  Procedure: After satisfactory anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped in a routine fashion for abdominal surgery.  Time-out confirmed patient and procedure.  The abdomen was entered with a Pfannenstiel approach.  The rectus muscle was dissected from the anterior rectus fascia with Mayo scissors and electrocautery.  On entry into the abdominal cavity multiple adhesions were noted among the omentum, the uterus, and the anterior abdominal wall.  The adhesions were dissected from the anterior abdominal wall and in two places was clamped, separated and ligated with 2-0 Chromic Gut suture.  A bladder flap was created and then a transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and extended laterally with the surgeon's fingers.  Amniotic fluid was clear.  The above described infant A was delivered from the Cephalic presentation.  The cord was clamped and cut and the baby handed to the pediatrician.  The above described infant B was delivered from the Breech presentation.  The cord was clamped and cut and the baby handed to the pediatrician.Blood for gases and DNA was obtained.  The placenta was delivered with cord traction.  The uterus was wiped out with a lap.  The uterus was closed in a single layer closure using 0-Vicryl.  The bladder flap was inspected and hemostasis was assured.  The peritoneum was re-approximated with 2-0 Chromic suture in a running fashion.  The fascia was closed with 2 sutures of 0-Vicryl starting at the angles and running in a continuous fashion, meeting in the middle. The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated with saline and re-approximated with 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with 3-0 Monocryl in a subcuticular fashion.  Steri strips and dry sterile dressing were applied.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.
