[**DATE**]  Congenital Heart Center Fetal Cardiac Program Inpatient Consult Note  Reason for consult: Known unbalanced AV canal in fetus, with maternal PPROM. Requesting physician: [**NAME**]  HPI: [**NAME**] is a 29 year old female G3P0202 who is currently ~ 31 weeks GA. EDC [**DATE**]. She was transferred from Dr. [**NAME**] at [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] Medical Group in [**LOCATION_CITY**] for PPROM on [**DATE**]. She was receiving prenatal care from Dr. [**NAME**] also from [**LOCATION_CITY**], FL and was also seen by Dr. [**NAME**] of Nemours Children's Clinic who did a fetal echocardiogram at 27 weeks GA which showed unbalanced AV canal with right dominance, hypoplastic left heart and aortic valve annulus. She stated that while watching TV the night prior to admission, she felt a trickle of fluid, and it continued to leak while she went to the bathroom. Due to prior history of PPROM in her second child with preterm delivery at 36 weeks, she suspected rupture of membranes and went to the hospital. At [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**], she was confirmed to have PPROM, was given antibiotics, started on Mag, and a dose of steroids. She did not have contractions, though complained of some cramping. Good fetal movement. She reports to have an amniocentesis done which showed normal karyotype. She did not know if microarray was sent.  On her last fetal echocardiogram done by Dr. [**NAME**], [**DATE**], at 27 weeks GA, the fetal cardiac anatomy are as follows: Unbalanced AV canal with right ventricular dominance.  Ostium primum ASD. AV canal type (inlet) VSD. Common AV vlave. Discrepant vessel size (pulmonary artery dominance0. Hypoplastic aortic annulus, mild aortic arch hypoplasia. Moderately hypoplastic left ventricle. Mild RV dilation.   She is currently taking prenatal MVI, progesterone and Zantac. She has no known drug allergies.  Her past medical and surgical history is significant for previous acute cholecystitis S/P cholecystectomy, S/P cervical biopsy, GERD. She denies history of diabetes, hypertension, or heart disease, hepatitis, liver disease, seizure disorder, thyroid disease, renal disease, thromboembolic disease or or pulmonary disease.   Her OB history is as follows:  1st pregnancy [**DATE**] - preterm delivery at 36 weeks GA, healthy baby with no issues. 3033g 2nd pregnancy  [**DATE**] - preterm delivery at 36 weeks GA, 2683 g, otherwise healthy baby with no issues.  Her family history shows that there were heart murmurs in her maternal side of the family.  No other family history of known congenital heart disease, cardiac rhythm disease, nor anyone with pacemakers, no sudden death before the age of 55 years old, no thyroid disease. Maternal Grandmother had distant relatives with possible genetic syndromes. No significant family history from father of the baby.  Her social history shows that she currently works as a veterinary tech. She denies exposure to cat litter during this pregnancy. She is not married. The father of the baby is 32 years old, and is an electrician.  She denies smoking during this pregnancy, recreational drug or NSAID use. She admits to drinking caffeinated beverages during this pregnancy.  A complete 2-D, color, and spectral fetal Doppler echocardiographic study and interpretation was performed at 31 weeks gestational age for history of fetal unbalanced AV canal and hypoplastic aortic valve.  Levocardia. There is situs solitus, four cardiac chambers and crossing of outflow tracts. Complete and possibly mildly unbalanced atrioventricular canal with very mild right dominance. Trivial atrioventricular valve regurgitation with multiple jets. Qualitatively mildly dilated right ventricular size with normal systolic function. In short axis, possibly very mildly hypoplastic left ventricle with normal left ventricular systolic function. Dysplastic and mildly hypoplastic aortic valve annulus with mild flow acceleration across the valve. No aortic valve regurgitation. Low normal ascending aortic dimensions, and mildly hypoplastic aortic isthmus. Patent ductus arteriosus and patent foramen ovale with normal intrauterine right to left flow. No pericardial effusion.  Assessment and Plan: [**NAME**] is a 29 year old, G3P2, 31 weeks GA, PPROM with the above fetal cardiac diagnosis. The above diagnosis and its medical and surgical implications were discussed in detail with Ms. [**NAME**]. The full spectrum of possible outcomes were discussed including the possible need for early surgical repair if there is significant left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. If the left ventricle is adequate, we anticipate biventricular repair. If left ventricle is more hypoplastic at delivery, then 3-stage single ventricle-palliation should be anticipated.  We agree with current obstetric management and possible delivery at 34 weeks GA. Again, depending on the degree of left-sided obstruction (if coarctation of the aorta or significant aortic stenosis is present after delivery), this may be a ductal dependent lesion, and baby will possibly need prostaglandins. The association of complete atrioventricular canal and Trisomy 21 was also discussed. Mother reports that her amniocentesis results were normal.  The findings and limitations of the exam and the limitations of fetal echocardiography in general including the inability to rule out septal defects, anomalies of venous return, coarctation of the aorta and some valvar defects, were discussed with Ms. [**NAME**].  Follow-up fetal echocardiogram in 2 weeks to reassess left ventricular size, aortic annulus and aortic arch size.  I have spent more than 1 hour with this patient in which more than 50% of the time was spent in counseling the patient with th 2 fetal diagnoses, its medical and surgical implications, as well as coordination of care.  Findings communicated with [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] OB and MFM teams, Drs. [**NAME**] and [**NAME**].  Thank you very much for letting us participate in your patient's care. Should you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to call our office.
