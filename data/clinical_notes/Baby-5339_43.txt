Mom's nipples are cracked and bruised, I helped mom latch the baby onto the breast with the 20 mm nipple shield and the baby did have a good latch but continued to come to the tip of the nipple. As I assessed the baby's suck the baby did a lot of chomping and occassionly bring the tongue to the ridged not exactly over the ridge. Mom wants to breast feed to help her baby. Pumping was also initiated, and I taught her how to do hand expression. Mom instructed to pump after breastfeeding for 10 minutes to help increase her milk supply. Mom was in agreement with the plan. Mom instructed to express some colostrum onto the nipple shield and do breast compressions while the baby was breastfeeding. MD  [**NAME**] made aware of the breastfeeding problem,and the condition of the mom's nipples.
