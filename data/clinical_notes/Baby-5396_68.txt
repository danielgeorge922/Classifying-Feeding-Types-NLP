Mom is breastfeeding but her breast felt slightly engorged  During rounds, I started mom with pumping and taught her how to use the manual pump. Breastfeeding d/c instructions given and referred to the Center for Breastfeeding. Mom encouraged to call the office if she has any concerns.  Mom is breastfeeding every 2 hours and states the baby is doing well.
