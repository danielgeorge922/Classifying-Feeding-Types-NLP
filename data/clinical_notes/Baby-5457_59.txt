I evaluated this patient and examined the patient at bedside.  I agree with the above examination and plan of care. The patient remains neurologically stable without clinical or electrical seizures.  Reviewed the radiological images in detail comparing the first MRV in [**DATE**] before craniotomy to the most resent MRV in [**DATE**].  The large deep venous sinuses appear normal and open.  The cortical draining veins change in caliber between each study.  The fist MRV and CTA showed decrease in cortical veins over the right hemisphere.  There was possible stenosis in several left hemispheric veins.  The MRV in [**DATE**] showed an occlusion in the right vein of Trolard which was open previously.  The latest study again shows decreased draining veins on the left.  There is increased right temporal edema on current study compared to [**DATE**].  There is no diffusion abnormality making Lymphoma or arterial stroke unlikely.  The edema may be secondary to venous occlusion vs. Inflammatory process.  Given the unclear diagnosis and the near delivery with a postpartum hypercoagulability opt to initiate anticoagulation.  Will participate in the multidisciplinary meeting on Wednesday.  Post delivery will obtain a contrast MRI before determining subsequent plan.
