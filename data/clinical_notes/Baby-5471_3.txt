Attestation  I saw and evaluated the patient. I reviewed and agree with the findings and plan as documented in the note. I reviewed the patient's history. I discussed this patient with the resident/fellow.  Comments: Patient is 9 mo pregnant, was pushed down by her BF onto her belly, complains of low abdominal pain only. No vag bleed, leak. No other injuries. Abdomen is gravid, soft, non-rigid. VS stable. Clear for L&D. Will transfer from ED to L&D now.
