Social work met bedside with MOB re: recent history of domestic violence.  Please see previous social work services progress note for continuity.  MOB reports she had, until delivery, resided with FOB's mother (PGM).  She reports FOB "stayed there sometimes" but that he didn't reside there permanently because he wasn't on the lease and that PGM could "get in trouble or kicked out" of the public housing apartment if he/they were caught staying there.  MOB reports the incident that led to current hospitalization and subsequent delivery put PGM's housing at risk and neither are welcome to stay there at this time.  MOB reports she has since moved in with her grandparents.    MOB denies domestic violence (DV) as the cause for her abdominal trauma.  MOB reports she and FOB were "arguing" and he went to leave by riding his bike, but MOB reports she tried to stop him and she "accidentally" fell over.  MOB denies he intentionally pushed or shoved her.  MOB denies feeling threatened or unsafe at any point during their argument.  MOB reports she did not call the police or EMS, however they both showed up because a family member notified them.  MOB reports immediately following the incident she contacted a family member to take her to the hospital to be checked due to her abdominal trauma.  She reports that family member notified the police.  MOB reports FOB never left the scene, and when police arrived neither she nor FOB wanted to press charges because they didn't believe anything unlawful had occurred.  She reports the police officer didn't arrest either party, but issued a sworn complaint.  MOB continues to deny that FOB has ever hit, hurt, shoved, pushed, or intimidated her in any way.  She denies he restricts her from visiting with friends, family, or financial resources.  MOB disclosed that this pregnancy she was arrested for damaging FOB's vehicle because she was angry with him.  Social work discussed concerns re: their ability to safely care for a newborn given their history.  Discussed risk of Shaken Baby Syndrome and other abuses to a child, as well as the potential for DCF involvement.  MOB reports she has no plans to resume residing with FOB, as she has moved with her grandparents, both of whom are involved and supportive.  MOB reports plans to stay there indefinitely.  MOB was very willing to accept a referral to Healthy Start services, which could help her and FOB develop appropriate parenting skills/techniques.  Discussed appropriate ways to cope with the new stressor of single parenting, as well as recent transition to her family's home, and the on-going issues between her and FOB.  Educated her on DV resources and the cycle of violence, both as the aggressor and the victim.    MOB reports an unplanned, but desired pregnancy.  Discussed her plans for birth control.  MOB was observed providing care for newborn, and appears to be bonding appropriately.  She reports adequate preparations at home, including a car seat, bassinet, clothes, and diapers.  She reports her family is planning to be involved and supportive, and it is expected FOB will be involved to co-parent.  MOB has identified CMS as the facility to follow newborn care.  She reports having acces to transportation, has Medicaid, WIC, and receives Food Stamps.            MOB reports a history of marijuana use prior to the knowledge of her pregnancy.
