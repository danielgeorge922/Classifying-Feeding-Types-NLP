ATTENDING DISCHARGE SUMMARY:  DOA:  [**DATE**] DOD: [**DATE**]  HOSPITAL COURSE;  The patient was admitted on the evening of [**DATE**] at 37 weeks gestation for evaluation of "decreased fetal movement."  NST was initially reactive, but then showed a prolonged deceleration.  Ultrasound showed decreased amniotic fluid.  Induction was begun.  On the afternoon of [**DATE**], the patient developed an arrest of dilation at 5 cm.  The FHR tracing also became non-reassuring --> recurrent severe variable decelerations.  Therefore, an urgent cesarean delivery was performed under general anethesia (the patient's labor epidural was ineffective).  The male baby had normal APGAR scores and normal blood gases.  Interestingly, at the time of surgery, we noted evidence of an occult cord prolapse.  The mother's postoperative course was uncomplicated.  Her postoperative HCT was 31 vol%.  The baby was noted to be "tongue-tied" and is scheduled to have the frenulum released prior to discharge today.  DISPOSITION:  1.  The patient is discharged to the care of her husband at home. 2. She was given routine postoperative instructions. 3.  She was given prescriptions for Percocet and ibuprofen. 4.  She will make a decision about contraception when she meets with me at her postoperative appointment.  [**NAME**], MD.
