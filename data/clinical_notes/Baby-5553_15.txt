No further social work interventions planned unless otherwise contacted Yes    Social work met with MOB at the request of medical staff due to limited support and recent move from out-of-state.  [**NAME**] (21y/o) and paternal grandmother, [**NAME**], remained at bedside with MOB's permission.  MOB reports prior to moving to FL she resided in GA with her father and stepmother.  She reports the home was "tiny," didn't have enough room for her and baby, and that GA was not a "good" place to raise a family.  MOB reports that FOB resided in the home intermittently when he was able to work and pay rent.  FOB reports when he wasn't residing with MOB, he stayed "couch surfing" between 2 friends.    A review of medical records indicates MOB with history of substance abuse.  It should be noted that in doing a review of records, social work did not note a previous urine toxicology screen from MOB's limited PNC, other than the one she submitted to at delivery which revealed negative results.  MOB minimized any history of substance use or misuse, and reported that approximately 3 years ago she experimented with xanax, which was brief and never led to an arrest, substance abuse treatment, or the on-going purchase pills.  MOB denies any substance use or misuse this pregnancy.  FOB denies any substance abuse history.  Parents report they both smoke cigarettes, but do not smoke in the house or in vehicles.  Educated parents re: 2nd and 3rd hand smoke and encouraged hand sanitizing and changing clothes.  Parents decline smoking cessation information at this time.    MOB reports for the last 4 months she and FOB have resided in a safe and stable home environment with paternal grandmother, who is employed, involved, and supportive.  Parents report they have all necessary infant care items in place, including a crib, bassinet, clothes, diapers, changing table, and bottles.  Parents have been observed providing newborn care in a consistent manner and appear to be responding to newborn cues.  Parents appear to be bonding appropriately.    Parents report they have registered into Medicaid, have chosen a facility for newborn care, have WIC, and are awaiting approval for Food Stamps.  Paternal grandmother reports she is currently supporting parents and newborn with whatever help they need.  Parents have agreed to a Healthy Start referral (in-home parenting support and education program).  Parents report they have their own drivers license and transportation, and deny barriers to pediatric medical care.    MOB denies history of depression, but discussed signs and symptoms of post partum depression.  Discussed with parents SIDS, Shaken Baby Syndrome, smoking cessation, and Back to Sleep.      No further social work interventions indicated at this time unless otherwise notified.
