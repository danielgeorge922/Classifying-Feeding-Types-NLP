Liveborn infant female weighing 3615 grams with Apgars of 9 and 9.  Indication: [**NAME**] is a 39 y.o. female para 8018 who prese  Procedure: After satisfactory anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped in a routine fashion for abdominal surgery.  Time-out confirmed patient and procedure.  The abdomen was entered with a Pfannensteil approach.  A bladder flap was created and then a transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and extended laterally with surgeon's fingers.  Amniotic fluid was clear.  The above described infant was delivered from the oblique/transverse presentation.  The cord was clamped and cut and the baby handed to the pediatrician.  Blood for gases and DNA was obtained.  The placenta was delivered with cord traction.  The uterus was wiped out with a lap.  40 units of pitocin was infused IV following delivery of the placenta, and the patient was given a prophylactic dose of 200 mcg of Methergine IM.  The uterus was closed in a double layer closure using 0-monocryl.    The right fallopian tube was identified by the fimbria, double ligated with 0-chromic suture and the intervening segment excised.  The left fallopian tube was identified by the fimbria, double ligated with 0-chromic suture and the intervening segment excised.  The bladder flap was inspected and hemostasis was achieved with a combination of Bovie cautery and Aristra.  The uterus was firm and had involuted to 2 cm below the umbilicus at time of fascial closer.  The fascia was closed with 2 sutures of 0-Vicryl starting at the angle and running in a continuous fashion. The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and re-approximated with 3-0 vicryl in 2 layers in interrupted fashion.  The skin was closed with 4-0 polysorb.  Steri-strips and a bandage were applied.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  1000 mcg of misoprostol was placed for prophylaxis at the end of the procedure.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.  [**NAME**]  Dictated for: [**NAME**]
