She was treated with magnesium for seizure prophylaxis and progressed to C/C/+1. She developed oliguria and increased creatinine to 1.53 with a magnesium level of 9.2. Her magnesium was discontinued and the decision was made to proceed with cesarean delivery due to worsening maternal status.   Procedure: After satisfactory anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped in a routine fashion for abdominal surgery.  Time-out confirmed patient and procedure.  The abdomen was entered with a Pfannensteil approach.  A bladder flap was not created and then a transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and extended laterally with fingers.  Amniotic fluid was clear. A nuchal cord x1 was reduced and the above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation.  The cord was clamped and cut and the baby handed to the pediatrician.  Blood for gases and DNA was obtained.  The placenta was delivered with cord traction.  The uterus was wiped out with a lap.  The uterus was closed in a double layer closure using 0-monocryl. The peritoneum was closed with 3-0 vicryl. The fascia was closed with 1 suture/s of 0-Vicryl starting at the angle and running in a continuous fashion. The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and closed with a running suture of 3-0 vicryl.  The skin was closed with 4-0 polysorb.  Benzoin and steristrips were applied.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.  H [**NAME**] MD
