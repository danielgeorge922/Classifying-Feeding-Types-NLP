Pt returned to room.  VSS, afebrile.  She said she's been to the [**LOCATION_OTHER**] visiting her children's dad.  She states that she fell asleep while there, woke up & came straight back to L&D.  She cont to deny pain.  I told her that I reported to L.King ARNP that she had been gone for a long time.  She said it won't happen again.  Her behavior is appropriate & she doesn't smell of alcohol or cigarettes.
