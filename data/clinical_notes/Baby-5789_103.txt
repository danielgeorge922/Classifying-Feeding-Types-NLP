Will workup patient's tachycardia, shortness of breath, and dry cough. Treat appropriately.  2. If workup negative, will proceed with cesarean delivery today given recent death of Twin A, increased MCA velocity of Twin B likely associated with anemia, and twin B with minimal short term BTBV and recurrent variable decelerations on FHT.  3. If patient does not show signs of pulmonary edema related to magnesium toxicity or fluid overload, will place patient on magnesium for NP prior to delivery.  4. Pt is NPO and C/S antibiotics have been ordered.   [**NAME**], MD
