MOB presented as guarded regarding her history and provided only limited information to this writer.  She eventually asked social work to get out of her room and discontinued the assessment.  MOB reports residing for the last 5 months in a safe and stable home environment with friends who are involved and supportive.  She reports her other children (5y/o, 1y/o) are currently in the "temporary" custody of their father because the "judge is a jerk."  She reports DCF was involved and she only has supervised visitation with those children.  MOB reports since September she has been enrolled in the outpatient methadone treatment program at Meridian.  MOB would not authorize social work to obtain a copy of the results of her urine toxicology screens from this pregnancy, but did disclose she tested for ETOH 5-7 times.  She reports drinking "... a beer every now and then because I was constipated."    It should be noted that MOB has requested multiple times to be off the unit to smoke or get sodas.  She has asked the charge nurse, bedside nurse, has requested volunteers, and has asked other admitted patients to care for newborn while she goes off the unit to smoke.  She has been observed leaving the newborn unattended for an unknown period of time.    Social work reported concerns to MOB and suggested that DCF would be notified to ensure safe discharge of newborn.  MOB became argumentative and defensive and asked social work to leave.  Due to concerns regarding MOB's ability to care for newborn in a safe and consistent manner, a report was made to and accepted by FL Abuse Hotline ([**CONTACT_PHONE**]-ABUSE) with an immediate response indicated.  [**LOCATION_CITY**] County DCF protective investigator, [**NAME**] ([**CONTACT_PHONE**]) initiated investigation.  Social work plans to remain involved pending outcome of DCF investigation.
