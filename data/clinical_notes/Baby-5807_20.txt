No further social work interventions planned unless otherwise contacted Yes    Social work met privately with MOB re: history of domestic violence, opioid dependence, DCF, limited PNC, and extramural delivery.    MOB reports residing in a safe and stable home environment with her 4y/o child and FOB (same FOB to both children), Timon Welch.  MOB reports in October he was arrested and charged for battery against her.  She reports her other child did not witness the altercation and DCF did not get involved.  MOB reports she and FOB continue to reside together, and that FOB is currently on probation, has completed court ordered services, such as anger management classes, individual and couples counseling, and has passed routine urine drug screens.  A review of PNC records indicates her OB team was aware of this incident and routinely offered her domestic violence services and education.  MOB continued to report feeling safe and declined services.  When asked today, MOB reports feeling safe, denies that FOB has touched/threatened/intimidated/verbally abused her.  MOB reports the incident in October was the first time he had done anything of that nature.    MOB reports a history of substance abuse that eventually led her to outpatient methadone treatment approximately 4 years ago.  She reports her last baby suffered from severe withdrawal and was hospitalized in the NICU for 19 days.  MOB reports she was also taking other drugs at that time and DCF became became involved, however she never lost custody of her baby and sought appropriate substance abuse treatment instead.  She reports the case has since closed and she continues to have custody of her special needs child.  MOB reports prior to learning of her pregnancy, she sought pain management care with Dr. [**NAME**] at the After Hours Clinic who transitioned her to subutex.  She reports when she learned she was pregnant she remained on that medication because she believed it would be less harmful to her fetus.  MOB reports taking the medication throughout this pregnancy and only as prescribed.  MOB denies any other substance use or misuse.  It should be noted that urine toxicology screen revealed negative results on newborn.        MOB reports an extramural delivery was not related to transportation issues or other barriers to seeking medical care.  She reports she called L&D and reported her contractions and they told her to come to the hospital.  She reports she was packing her bags when she realized the baby was about to come, so FOB immediately called EMS.  MOB reports the person on the phone walked FOB through the safe delivery and then EMS transported them to STH.    MOB reports limited PNC was due to unreliable transportation.  Educated her on Medicaid transportation services, which she reports using several times in the past.  It is not clear why she didn't utilize this service for her PNC, however she denies transportation barriers to pediatric care.  She reports her plans to have newborn followed at CMS, as that is where her other child attends.  MOB reports having all necessary infant care items in place, and appears to be bonding appropriately with newborn.  MOB reports an unplanned, but desired pregnancy.
