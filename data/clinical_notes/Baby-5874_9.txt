To bedside to place foley.  Pt placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  Foley bulb tested, trimmed and cleansed with betadine.  SVE without change from prior.  Foley bulb passed through the internal os and inflated with 60cc of saline.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The external end of the catheter was clamped and taped on traction to the patient's medial thigh.    Will start pitocin.  [**NAME**] MD MA
