I discussed patient with Dr. [**NAME**] and we reviewed her history, her blood pressures, and labs throughout her hospital course.    At 1500, I repeated her preE panel and her platelets were slightly lower than they had been at 116 but remainder of labs were normal, she was asymptomatic, and NST reassuring and reactive.  Her platelets were previously 124 at OSH and then increased here and were stable around 170s.  Given the fluctuance and the fetal cardiac anomalies, will repeat panel at 6AM and review trend of platelets.  If platelets lower, other labs abnormal, blood pressures worsen, or if she begins to have symptoms will consider induction at that time.  I examined her cervix, it was FT/40/high.  Cephalic confirmed with ultrasound.    I discussed all of the above with the patient and she expressed understanding of the plan.    [**NAME**] MD
