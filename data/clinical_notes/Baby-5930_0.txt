Attestation  I saw and evaluated the patient. I reviewed and agree with the findings and plan as documented in the note. I reviewed the patient's history. I discussed this patient with the resident/fellow.  Comments: Patient is G1P0 at approx 36 weeks presents with clear vaginal fluid leakage. No bleeding, contractions - just some mild "cramps". Brief vaginal exam by Dr. [**NAME**] with sterile gloves showed no crowning or imminent delivery. Will send to L&D.
