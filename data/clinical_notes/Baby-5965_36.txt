Lactation note: mom is bottle feeding than breastfeeding. She states that she is not making enough milk . I made her aware that the baby does not need a lot right now and that she has what the baby needs and that as she continues to stimulate her breast by breastfeeding the supply will increase. Mom's plan to continue to bottle feed formula and breast feed when her milk comes. Mom is aware of the potential risk of decreased milk supply. She will f/u in her WIC office upon discharge. The breastfeeding d/c packet given with d/c instructions.
