Lactation note: mom states that she is bottle feeding because the is having difficulty latching onto the breast; the baby does not latch on at all and she states she does not have anything coming out of her breast.  3 days post-partum and I was able to hand express a drop of colostrum which appeared to have some transitional milk. Mom really wants to give the baby breast milk. I taught mom how to hand express and I changed her flange from a 24 mm to a 27 mm.  I did a pumping session with mom and I taught her how to use the manual.  Mom states that the flanges feel comfortable and understand the plan to pump every 2 -3 hours for 15 minutes. Breastfeeding d/c packet given with instructions, and encouraged to call the office if she has any concerns.
