Evaluated patient for potential PDPH. Patient reported increasing headache pain yesterday with some episodes of severe pain in head and neck with numbness in left arm after awakening from sleep last night. Today pain is less and patient denies severe pain when sitting up or arm numbness. Neurological exam shows no deficits and good strength and sensation. She has some mild muscle tenderness in her neck and around the epidural site. She has been afebrile. Patient also reports decreasing headache pain with caffeine consumption this AM. At this time do not believe patient has PDPH particularly since her symptoms have improved and she is able to be upright for longer periods without increasing pain. Encouraged patient to continue with adequate tylenol and NSAIDs, hydration, caffeine as needed, and being up OOB as able. Patient instructed to contact L & D if severe headache symptoms return and patient agreed. From our standpoint patient is okay for discharge.
