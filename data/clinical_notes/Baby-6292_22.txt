Lactation note:  I hand expressed and taught mom how to do hand expression and apply her colostrum to the nipple before she puts the baby onto the breast. I assisted mom with latching the baby onto the breast and the baby had a good latch but she was chomping and then went into a rhythmic suck. Mom instructed to do breast compressions while she is breastfeeding . Md [**NAME**] assessed the baby and would like to see how the baby does during the evening. He recommended the baby use an orange pacifier to help with the sucking coordination.
