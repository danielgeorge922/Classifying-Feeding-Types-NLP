Date of Surgery:  [**DATE**]  Preoperative Diagnosis:  1) 39 weeks 2) Failed induction 3) Suspicious fetal heart tracing 4) Meconium 5) Gestational diabetes - diet controlled 6) Chronic hypertension - no medications 7) Undesired fertility  Postoperative Diagnosis: Same  Operation Performed: Primary Low Transverse cesarean section, Bilateral Parkland Tubal Interruption  Surgeon: [**NAME**]  Assistant: [**NAME**]  Anesthesia: Spinal  Pathology: bilateral segments of tube  EBL: 800 ml  Findings: Normal uterus, tubes and ovaries bilaterally.  Liveborn infant male weighing 2702 grams with Apgars of 9 and 9. Arterial cord pH 7.24 and venous cord pH 7.31.   Indication: [**NAME**] is a 33 y.o. female para 1011 who presented at 39 weeks for scheduled induction of labor for CHTN, GDM and cholelithiasis with plans for surgery postpartum. Due to an unfavorable cervix she was started on miso/foley induction. The foley came out and she progressed to 5 cm on miso alone. Pitocin was started and she began to have deep variable decelerations with contractions. She ruptured spontaneously with meconium noted. Given nonreassuring fetal tracing that worsened with pitocin administration remote from delivery, decision was made to proceed with cesarean delivery.   Procedure: After satisfactory anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped in a routine fashion for abdominal surgery.  Time-out confirmed patient and procedure.  The abdomen was entered with a Pfannensteil approach.  A bladder flap was not created and then a transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and extended laterally with the surgeon's fingers.  Amniotic fluid was meconium.  The above described infant was delivered from the cephalic presentation.  The cord was clamped and cut and the baby handed to the pediatrician.  Blood for gases and DNA was obtained.  The placenta was delivered with cord traction.  The uterus was wiped out with a lap.  The uterus was closed in a single layer closure using 0-vicryl ran continuously across the hysterotomy in a running, locked fashion.   The right fallopian tube was identified by the fimbria, double ligated with 0-chromic suture and the intervening segment excised.  The left fallopian tube was identified by the fimbria, double ligated with 0-chromic suture and the intervening segment excised.    The fascia was closed with 1 suture of 0-Vicryl starting at the angle and running in a continuous fashion. The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and reapproximated with a running stitch of 3-0 vicryl.  The skin was closed with a running intracuticular stitch of 4-0 monocryl. Dermabond was applied.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.  [**NAME**]  Dictated for: [**NAME**] MD   I was present for the entire case.  I reviewed the resident's note and made appropriate corrections and additions to it.
