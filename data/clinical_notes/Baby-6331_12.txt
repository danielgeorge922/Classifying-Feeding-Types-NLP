I met with Ms. [**NAME**] regarding the possibility of delivering her baby at 23 weeks. We discussed the extremely poor prognosis for survival of a male infant . Estimated fetal weight undetermined at this point. We discussed possible complications of prematurity including, but not limited to, HMD, IVH, PVL, ROP, NEC, CLD, CP, need for mechanical ventilation,  and death. We discussed the long hospitalizations experienced by survivors. We discussed immediate concerns at delivery, such as  inability to establish airway due to small size and extremely poor prognosis if CPR were required. I explained that at this borderline viable gestation age, we would support her decision for comfort care only, airway management only, or full resuscitation with offer of withdrawal of support if some catastrophe of prematurity became apparent. At the time that I left, she informed me that she did want neonatology present for delivery to assess baby. She expressed that she did not want neonatology to perform CPR or do a chest tube, but reserves the right to change her mind in the delivery room. Thank you for this consult. Please do not hesitate to contact neo on call for further questions or concerns
