Paged by Nurse as patient wanted a visit but not life threatening so told that I would speak on telephone which I did and would stop by to see her when in hospital this was Friday, [**DATE**].  I  visited patient [**NAME**] today, [**DATE**] and her significant male companion.  Jenae is 31 weeks pregnant but has signficant medical issues and hopes to be induced later this month.  I answered all of thier spiritual questions and read scripture.  We then prayed.  I informed her that I would stop by later and check on her when I am back in the hospital and that she could have me paged and I could speak on the telephone with her.  She is a 21 year old female who is Pentecostal.  Chaplain provided spiritual care through prayer, pastoral presence, and reflective listening.  [**NAME**]+
