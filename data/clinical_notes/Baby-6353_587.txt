Patient evaluated per request of nursing to be sure she was not at risk of harm to herself or others. She was told earlier this evening by social work that she would not be getting custody of her baby and was to call in for a court hearing tomorrow morning. The patient was very upset by this news and created some concern on the floor apparently with her yelling earlier (per patient she was merely praying and states she cannot just ignore God when he comes in). When I came to evaluate the patient she was sitting very calmly on the bed with a friend beside her (someone she has known for years from pediatric adolescent palliative care) and although tearful at times seemed appropriately upset and was cooperative. She denied any suicidal or homicidal thoughts and stated that she felt very safe, just felt she had been wronged by some of the people here. She is very upset by the fact that she thinks she has been misrepresented in medical records portraying her as noncompliant. I told the patient I was very sorry to hear what she is going through and just want to be sure that she is in a safe place mentally right now with everything that she has learned today but that I would not be able to addend her medical record or comment further as I have not been taking care of the patient throughout her stay. I was also asked by nursing about ordering Ativan for anxiety, but when I mentioned the possibility of this medication to the patient she seemed confused about why she would even need this. States she does not feel anxious and declines any medications at this time.  [**NAME**], MD
