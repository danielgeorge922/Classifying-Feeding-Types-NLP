Problem: Impaired swallow (SLP) Goal: SLP LTG: Patient will tolerate the least restrictive diet consistency: [**DATE**] LTG: Patient will tolerate the least restrictive diet consistency to allow for safe consumption of daily meals by discharge.  Outcome: Ongoing [**DATE**]:  Pt seen for swallowing therapy f/u.  Pt has now been transferred to the floor and diet upgraded to mechanical soft.    Pt reports that she swallows fine when her Mestinon dose is timed so that it is given about 1 hour prior to meal time. But, when Mestinon is given less than 1 hour before, or, is given after a meal, she has difficulty with swallowing.  She also reports that her voice/resonance changes and she become hyper-nasal when the Mestinon is wearing off.  This hyper-nasality is a very functional clinical sign that her medication is wearing off and that pt's swallowing has declined and aspiration risk has increased.  Discussed the dose schedule with the RN.  RN reports that the dosing has been timed to be given after meals, and that she has noticed the issues with swallowing and hyper-resonance, and did not realize the relationship between swallowing safety and medication dosing.  The RN f/u'd with pharmacy, and pt's dose schedule has been adjusted to accommodate meal schedule and will now be given 60 minutes before scheduled meals.  Plan:  Continue with Mechanical Soft diet at this time.  Once pt is confident that her mestinon schedule is correct and that her pharyngeal strength has improved sufficiently, then, pt will be ready for upgrade to regular diet.    Speech Therapy will continue to f/u with the patient.  [**NAME**], PhD/CCC-SLP Pager [**CONTACT_PHONE**]
