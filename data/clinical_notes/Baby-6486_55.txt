Liveborn infant male with Apgars of 2, 6,  and 6.  Indication: [**NAME**] is a 27 y.o. female para 1112 who was admitted in the MICU with thyroid storm, tachycardia.  She developed fetal bradycardia in the 80s that did not respond to conservative mgmt and the decision made to proceed with Cesarean. She also desires permanent sterilization and understands that BTI is permanent, not reversible, has a 1% risk of failure and an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy if the BTI fails. She also understands that vasectomy and reversible methods are options.  Procedure: After satisfactory general anesthesia was obtained, the patient was pour prepped and draped in a routine fashion for abdominal surgery.  A time-out was taken to confirm patient and procedure.  The abdomen was entered via a Pfannenstiel incision. A bladder blade was placed. A bladder flap was not created. A low transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment and extended laterally and slightly superiorly.  Amniotic fluid was clear.  The above described infant was delivered atraumatically  from  Cephalic presentation.  The mouth and nose were suctioned, the cord was clamped and cut, and the infant was handed to the waiting pediatrician.  A sample of cord for blood for gases and DNA was obtained.  Cord blood was not collected for donation. The placenta was delivered with gentle cord traction and was sent to path.    The uterus was exteriorized and cleared of all clots. The uterine incision was closed in a running continuous fashion using 0 vicryl in a  single layer.  The right fallopian tube was identified and followed to its fimbriated end. A mid-isthmic section was identified and doubly ligated with 0-chromic suture. The intervening segment excised and sent to pathology. The exact same procedure was then performed on the left fallopian tube. The uterus was replaced into the abdomen and the pelvic gutters were irrigated.  The fascia was closed with 0-Vicryl in a running continuous fashion from either end and meeting in the middle.    The skin was closed in a running subcuticular fashion using 4-0 monocryl followed by application of Dermabond.   All counts were correct and the patient was sent to the recovery room in stable condition.   I was present for the entire surgery.
