Pt stated this am she wants to breastfeed. RN assisted pt to breastfeed at 1130 today. Pt has good supply and baby latched with little difficulty. However, this afternoon when baby was fusyy and refusing to latch, pt asked for a bottle. Explained supply and demand to pt, but pt appeared frustrated and again stated she wanted a bottle. Infant was fed 10 ml by pt, and then pt encouraged to do skin to skin. Pt also given breast pump per request.
