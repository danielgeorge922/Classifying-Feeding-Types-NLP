PGY4 Note:  Myself and Dr [**NAME**] met with the patient and her husband at bedside. Briefly, she is a 31 yo P1001 at 38w2d whose pregnancy has been complicated by GDM and GBS positive status. Her last pregnancy was complicated by a shoulder dystocia at 40 weeks which was resolved by McRobert's and suprapubic pressure. She was delivered by Dr [**NAME**] at [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**]. Baby had no neurologic deficits. The FOB and patient are not able to relay the amount of time that passed between delivery of the head and resolution of the dystocia, but they are able to articulate that she was never counseled against vaginal delivery in subsequent pregnancies.   She had a growth scan at 37 weeks which showed baby to be 3388 grams (65%ile) on [**DATE**]. Based upon this sono we estimate current EFW at 3800 grams.   We discussed at length the risks of shoulder dystocia with this pregnancy given her history of prior shoulder dystocia and now with GDM. We offered her a primary cesarean given this risk and counseled her extensively that this is our strong recommendation.   She indicated that this topic has been discussed with her primary OB, Dr [**NAME**], and she is aware of the associated risks including hypoxia and potential cerebral palsy, brachial plexus injury, fetal injury, perineal laceration including 3rd and 4th degree tears with possible associated incontinence and pain issues.   At this time we plan to continue with induction of labor per the patient's expressed wishes after extensive counseling. We indicated that she may change her mind at any point in her induction course and we would proceed with cesarean. We also relayed that we would readdress the current plan if we had any indication that her labor course was abnormal such as prolonged active phase or 2nd stage. We emphasized that we would be unwilling to assist the 2nd stage with operative delivery via forceps or vacuum.   At the conclusion of our discussion, all of the patient's questions were answered to her satisfaction.  [**NAME**], MD
