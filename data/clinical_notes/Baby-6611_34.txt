After cesarean delivery, left fallopian tube, IP ligament and broad ligament were found to have hematomas. Liveborn infant male weighing 2625 grams with Apgars of 5 and 9.  SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY:  INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 29 y.o. female para 4125 who was admitted to labor and delivery at 35 weeks for chest pain and then extended monitoring after falling and hitting her abdomen. The pt's tocometry showed uterine irritability and the pt complained of abdominal pain, but this subsided and FHT was reactive over the course of the evening.  At 0615, the pt returned from using the restroom and nursing was unable to obtain a fetal heart tone. A heart beat could not be seen on ultrasound but fetal movement was noted. The pt was moved to the OR and a normal heart rate was found on repeat ultrasound. It was felt the fetus likely had an episode of bradycardia. Given bradycardia in the setting of recent fall, abdominal pain, and uterine irritability, we proceeded with cesarean delivery.  DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a pfannensteil incision.  A bladder flap was created bluntly.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with the surgeon's fingers.  The amniotic fluid was clear.  The above described infant was delivered from the Breech presentation.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood was obtained for analysis.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.  The uterus was exteriorized, and the uterine incision was closed in 2 layers, the first a running locking suture of 0 Vicryl and the second a running, imbricating suture of 0 Vicryl.  Excellent hemostasis was noted.   Next attention was turned to the tubal ligation. The right fallopian tube was identified by the fimbria, double ligated with #1-plain gut suture and the intervening segment excised.  The left fallopian tube was identified by the fimbria, double ligated with #1 plain gut suture and the intervening segment excised.    It was noted after removing the segment of the left tube, that there was a small defect in the uterine serosa between the round ligament and fallopian tube. This was oversewn with a 3-0 vicryl.    The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity.  Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision. However on re-examination of the left fallopian tube and left infundipular pelvic ligament, the distal portion of the fallopian tube was noted to be forming a large hematoma as was the IP. The uterus was exteriorized. The distal portion of the fallopian tube was removed by progressively clamping, cutting, and tying along the fallopian tube/mesosalping junction. After removal of the tube. The left side of the uterus was again inspected and noted to have an expanding hematoma of the broad ligament and infundibulopelvic ligament. It was felt that given expanding hematoma a hysterectomy was indicated to stop the expansion. At this point the pt was awake. We discussed the situation with the pt. She said she was planning on a hysterectomy later on for abnormal bleeding anyway. The pt was placed under general anesthesia after verbally consenting to hysterectomy.  The right round ligament was transfixion sutured with 0 Vicryl and divided with cautery (for the remainder of the dictation, all suture will be 0 Vicryl unless otherwise stated).  The anterior leaf broad of the broad ligament and the vesicouterine peritoneum on the patient's left side were incised with a combination of cautery and sharp dissection to a point below the uterine incision and broad ligament hematoma, but above the cervix.  The posterior leaf of the broad ligament was incised with cautery and sharp dissection. A defect was made in the posterior leaf of the broad ligament beneath the uteroovarian ligament and the proximal fallopian tube.  The uteroovarian ligament and the proximal fallopian tube were doubly clamped, incised, and doubly ligated; the second suture was a transfixion suture.The right uterine vessels were skeletonized. The right uterine vessels were doubly clamped, divided, and sutured.  The same process was repeated on the right side.    The left round ligament was transfixion sutured with 0 Vicryl and divided with cautery (for the remainder of the dictation, all suture will be 0 Vicryl unless otherwise stated).  The anterior leaf broad of the broad ligament and the vesicouterine peritoneum on the patient's left side were incised with a combination of cautery and sharp dissection to a point below the uterine incision and broad ligament hematoma, but above the cervix.  The posterior leaf of the broad ligament was incised with cautery and sharp dissection. The right uterine vessels were skeletonized. The left uterine vessels were doubly clamped, divided, and sutured.  The same process was repeated on the right side. A defect was made in the posterior leaf of the broad ligament beneath the uteroovarian ligament and the proximal fallopian tube.  The uteroovarian ligament and the proximal fallopian tube were doubly clamped, incised, and doubly ligated; the second suture was a transfixion suture.    The remainder of the bladder was separated from the underlying cervix with blunt dissection. The paracervical tissue was progressively clamped, incised, and ligated to a level below the uterine incision and broad ligament hematoma, but above the cervix.  Heaney clamps were placed across the uterus and the uterus was amputated using a scalpel. The specimen was handed off the surgical field.  Interrupted imbricating stitches of 0-vicryl were used to close the the uterine amputation site. The angles were closed with figure of eight stitches of 0-vicryl. Areas of bleeding were oversewn with figure of eight stitches of 0-vicryl. The pelvis was irrigated. The right ovary, tube and IP were examined and were noted to be intact without evidence of injury of hematoma. The right ureter was identified and was noted to be far away from the cervical stump and any suture material. Hemostasis along the right pelvic side wall was achieved with cautery and Arista. The left IP and ovary were examined. The IP hematoma had decreased slightly in size, however given concern for possible retroperitoneal extension, the decision was made to proceed with left oophorectomy. A defect was made in the posterior leaf of the broad ligament beneath the infundibulopelvic ligament and above the ureter.  The IP ligament was doubly clamped, incised, and doubly ligated; the second suture was a transfixion suture.  The ureter was identified before clamping and cutting the IP ligament. The ureter was also identified at the level of the cervical stump and was noted to be far away from the angles. Inspection of the entire field revealed hemostasis. There was a hematoma in the left retroperitoneum that was stable and becoming smaller. All pedicles were hemostatic as was the cervical stump at the completion. Throughout case there was communication with anesthesia regarding blood loss and patient recieved prbcs and FFP was ordered.    The fascia was closed with one suture of 0-vicryl starting at the angle and running continuously.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and hemostasis was assured.  The subcutaneous tissue was reapproximated with a running stitch of 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with 4-0 polysorb. Benzoin, Steri-Strips, and a sterile dressing were applied to the incision.   . An x-ray was performed that showed no retained instruments of laps. The patient was, awakened from anesthesia, and transferred to the SICU in a stable condition.  All counts were correct at the end of the procedure.  [**NAME**], MD
