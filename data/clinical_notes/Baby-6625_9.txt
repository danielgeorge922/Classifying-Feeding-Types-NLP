I discussed options for cremation +/- autopsy of twin A.  Patient declines both and wishes to have a burial.  She has to talk to the father of the babies but is rather sure of this choice.  She signed the yellow packet on the appropriate page.  Because she doesn't know which funeral home she will use, I gave her the phone numbers listed on the page to call to release the body from [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] to the funeral home.  I have completed the packet and gave the L&D clerk the packet.   [**NAME**] MD
