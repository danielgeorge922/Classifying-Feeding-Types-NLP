True knot in umbilical cord.  Liveborn infant male weighing 3013 grams with Apgars of 9 and 9.  SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY:  INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 34 y.o. female para 3013 with three prior cesarean deliveries, Hepatitis C, and undesired fertility. She presented to Labor and Delivery for a scheduled repeat cesarean and bilateral tubal interruption.  DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfannensteil incision. The incision was taken down to the level of the fascia which was incised in the midline. The incision was extended laterally in either direction over the rectus muscles. The fascia was dissected off the rectus muscle superiorly and then inferiorly. The rectus muscle was divided bluntly. The peritoneum was entered in a clear space sharply. Omental adhesions were lysed with electrocautery. A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with the surgeon's fingers.  The amniotic fluid was clear.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord blood was obtained for infant identification purposes.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.  The uterus was exteriorized, and the uterine incision was closed in two layers, the first a running suture of 0 Vicryl and the second a running, imbricating suture of 0 Vicryl.   The left fallopian tube was identified to its fimbriated end. A Babcock forcep was placed in the midisthmic portion of the left fallopain tube over a relatively avascular portion of the mesosalpinx. A defect was created bluntly in this area of the mesosalpinx with a hemostat. A portion of the tube was ligated on two sutures of plain gut and the intervening portion of tube was excised with Metzenbaum scissors. The portion of tube was handed off the field and prepared to be sent to Pathology. Hemostasis was ensured at the cut ends of the tube. The same procedure was repeated on the right side.  The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity.  Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision, posterior to the bladder, and in the subfascial area.  The closed uterine incision was irrigated. The fascia was closed with two sutures of 0 Vicryl beginning from either end of the incision and meeting in the midportion.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated. The skin was closed with staples.  A sterile dressing was applied to the incision.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.  [**NAME**], MD
