MOB presented as unguarded, open and honest with information.  A review of medical records indicates MOB with a history of Baker and Marchment Acts (one time each, most recent one year ago).  MOB reports she experienced an unstable life as a child, suffered physical and sexual abuse, and recently experienced the death of her mother.  She reports she was acting out her pain by experimenting with drugs and participating in gang related activity.  MOB reports due to her unstable childhood she also struggled with depression and has previously participated in counseling and was prescribed medications.  She reports she discontinued medication with this pregnancy and reports she experienced a mostly stable mood and denies SI or HI.  MOB reports her support is primarily FOB ([**NAME**] -- 23y/o) and his family, although she has a few family members that are safe and appropriate, namely the people with whom she currently resides.  MOB reports she is currently residing with distant family members that she has known most of her life.  She reports they are involved and supportive and would like her reside there with the baby for as long as she'd like.  MOB describes a more stable life since she has left the home of her father one year ago.  She reports FOB is very involved and supportive, does not do drugs or smoke, and has no criminal history.  She reports they do not currently reside together, but will eventually once he has stable employment.   MOB reports she has quit smoking 3 months ago and reports no plans to resume.  She reports there are no smokers in the home.    MOB has been observed to be caring for newborn in an appropriate manner and reports this was an unplanned, but desired pregnancy.  MOB reports her desire to parent newborn.    Due to concerns regarding MOB's history of inappropriate parenting role models she was agreeable to a referral to in-home services with Healthy Start and referral has been generated.  Social work also provided MOB with multiple newborn and parenting pamphlets.    No further social work interventions indicated at this time unless otherwise notified.
