Date of Surgery: [**DATE**]  Preoperative Diagnosis: 1) 37 week pregnancy 2) Prior cesarean x 3  4) History of uterine window  5) Undesired fertility  Postoperative Diagnosis: Same  Operation Performed: Low Transverse Cesarean Section, Bilateral Parkland tubal interruption  Surgeon: [**NAME**]  Assistant: [**NAME**]  Anesthesiologist: [**NAME**]  Anesthesiology Assistant: Fair  Anesthesia: Spinal  Pathology: Bilateral segments of tubes  EBL: 1000ml  Findings: Normal uterus, tubes and ovaries bilaterally.  Liveborn infant male weighing 2926 grams with Apgars of 9 and 9.  Indication: [**NAME**] is a 25 y.o. female para 3003 who was scheduled for repeat cesarean at 37 weeks due to a prior history of uterine window. The patient desired permanent sterilization.  Procedure: After satisfactory anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped in a routine fashion for abdominal surgery.  Time-out confirmed patient and procedure.  The abdomen was entered with a Pfannenstiel approach. The medial aspect of the each rectus muscle was transected with cautery to access the uterus.  A bladder flap was created and then a transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and extended laterally with the surgeon's fingers. The lower uterine segment was very thin but did not have an obvious window.  Amniotic fluid was clear.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation.  The cord was clamped and cut and the baby handed to the pediatrician.  Blood for gases and DNA was obtained.  The placenta was delivered with cord traction.  The uterus was wiped out with a lap.  The uterus was closed in a single layer closure using 0-Monocryl. The right fallopian tube was identified by the fimbria, grasped and elevated with a babcock. The mesosalpinx beneath the isthmic portion of the tube was cauterized with bovey. The tube was double ligated with 1-Plain gut suture and the intervening segment excised. The left fallopian tube was identified by the fimbria, grasped and elevated with a babcock. The mesosalpinx beneath the isthmic portion of the tube was cauterized with bovey. The tube was double ligated with 1-Plain gut suture and the intervening segment excised.   The uterus was reexamined and found to be hemostatic. The fascia was closed with 2 suture/s of 0-Vicryl starting at the angle and running in a continuous fashion. The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and reapproximated with 0-Chromic. The skin was closed with 4-0 Monocryl.  Steri strips and a bandage were applied.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.   [**NAME**]  Dictated for [**NAME**] MD I was present for the entire case.  I reviewed the resident's note and made appropriate corrections and additions to it.
