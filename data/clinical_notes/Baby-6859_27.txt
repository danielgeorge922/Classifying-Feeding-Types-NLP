Date of Surgery: [**DATE**]   PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  1) Intrauterine pregnancy at 28 weeks  2) Severe pre-eclampsia 3) Absent end diastolic flow of fetal umbilical arteries 4) Non reassuring fetal heart tracing  POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Same   PROCEDURE:  1) Primary Low transverse cesarean section   SURGEON: Dr. [**NAME**]  ASSISTANT: Dr. [**NAME**]   ANESTHESIOLOGIST: Dr. [**NAME**]  ANESTHESIA ASSISTANT: Dr. [**NAME**]   ANESTHESIA: General  EBL: 800mL   FINDINGS: Normal uterus, tubes and ovaries bilaterally. Liveborn infant male weighing 840 grams with Apgars of 1, 6, and 7.   SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY: Placenta   INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 21 y.o. female para 0 at 28w0d who was admitted as a transfer for severe pre-eclampsia.  She was given magnesium sulfate, IV antihypertensives including labetala and hydralazine were administered for severe range BP, she also received her first dose of betamethasone. Fetal status deteriorated with a low baseline in the 100's and absent variability. The decision to proceed with Stat Cesarean Delivery was made following a prolonged deceleration to the 80's.  DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table. A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed. After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.  The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a STAT Pfannenstiel incision. A bladder flap was not created. A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with the surgeons fingers. The amniotic fluid was clear. The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation. The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood was obtained for analysis. The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap. The uterus was exteriorized, and the uterine incision was closed in 2 layers, the first a running suture of 0 Monocryl and the second a running, imbricating suture of 0 Monocryl.  The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity. Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision, posterior to the bladder, and in the subfascial area. The fascia was closed with one suture of 0 Vicryl beginning from one end of the incision and running across to the other side. The subcutaneous tissue was closed with a running suture of 3-0 Vicryl. The skin was closed with a running subcuticular closure of 4-0 Polysorb. Benzoin, Steri-Strips, and a sterile dressing were applied to the incision. The vagina was cleared of clots. All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.
