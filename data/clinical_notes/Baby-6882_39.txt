Liveborn infant male weighing 2824 grams with Apgars of 9 and 9.  SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY:  INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 20 y.o. female para 0 who was admitted to labor and dleivery at 37 weeks for premature rupture of membranes. She was augmented with pitocin. However, she developed persistent variable decelerations unresponsive to conservative measures and was remote from delivery at 5 cm. For this reason the patient was taken to the OR for cesarean delivery.  DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a pfannensteil incision. The incision was taken down to the level of the fascia with sharp dissection; the fascia was scored in the midline. The incision was extended laterally in either direction over the rectus muscles. The fascia was dissected off the rectus muscle superiorly and then inferiorly. The rectus muscle was divided bluntly. The peritoneum was entered in a clear space sharply.  A bladder flap was created.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with blunt dissection  The amniotic fluid was clear.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation. The infant gave a spontaneous cry and extremity movement.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood was obtained for analysis.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.  The uterus was exteriorized, and the uterine incision was closed in 2 layers, the first a running locking suture of 0-vicryl and the second a running, imbricating suture of 0-vicryl.  The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity.  Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision, posterior to the bladder, and in the subfascial area.  The fascia was reapproximated with 0 Vicryl starting at the angle and running in a continuous fashion.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated.  The skin was closed with a running subcuticular closure of 3-0 monocryl.  Steri-Strips and a sterile dressing were applied to the incision.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.
