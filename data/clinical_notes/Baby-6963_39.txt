MOB called to front desk and requesting for formula, I went to patient room and verified request which patient affirm that she wants formula for Nb, she thinks that NB is not getting enough breastmilk and at the same time she said she don't like the cramping feeling that she felt on her abdomen she she breast fed. Re-educated mother on the benefits on breast feeding .I  asked her long term goal for the NB. She stated she really wanted to breast feed NB at home as long as she can. I medicated mother for cramping pain and I told her to wait for 30 to an hour for relief. NB is breast feeding at this time with good latch and suck, will continue to monitor.
