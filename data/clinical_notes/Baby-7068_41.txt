Pt c/o of moderate to severe pain with BF. Left breast is more painful than right, has cracking and bleeding. Pt states the severity of the pain is with the initial latch, but the longer the infant nurses the more tender the breast feels. Infant has nice wide mouth and deep latch, but pulls back and nurses directly on the nipple. RN assisted pt with obtaining deeper latch and pushing in more of the areola into infant's mouth with success, but infant tends to pull back and nurses again on the nipple. Pt is currently using nipple shield, lanolin, and cold packs with some slight relief. Pt would like to see lactation before discharge today.
