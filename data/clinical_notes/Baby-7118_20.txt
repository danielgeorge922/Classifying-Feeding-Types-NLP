Pt's cvx [**DATE**], head is Occiput transverse and asynclitic. There has been no change in cervical dilation or station in the last two hours despite adequate contractions. Given arrest of dilation, I discussed with the pt that we would recommend proceeding with cesarean delivery. The pt agreed and expressed understanding. The pt was consented for cesarean delivery and BTI.  PreOp Dx: Procedure: Cesarean Section Consents: The patient was counseled on R/B/I/C to cesarean section, including bleeding, infection, damage to adjacent organs, and reaction to anesthesia. Patient understands and consents to the procedure.  PreOp Dx: Undesired Fertility Procedure: BTI Consents: The patient was counseled on R/B/I/C to procedure including bleeding, infection, damage to adjacent organs, reaction to anesthesia, permanence of procedure, 1% failure rate, and increased risk of ectopic pregnancy should she become pregnant. Patient understands and wishes to proceed with procedure.   [**NAME**], MD
