I spoke with Ms. [**NAME**] about her plan of care.  She is at 29 weeks gestation with history of PPROM on [**DATE**].  She was started on magnesium for neuroprotection secondary to tracing concerns.  Her tracing has improved and this was discontinued.  Our plan is to monitor the tracing and restart magnesium for any concerns.  She will be delivered via cesarean delivery for maternal or fetal complications and/or at a later gestational age.  We will allow the patient to eat on a meal to meal basis based on fetal tracing.   [**NAME**], MD
