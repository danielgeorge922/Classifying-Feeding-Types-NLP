I was referred to this patient that delivered a newborn yesterday. Ms. [**NAME**] did not receive any prenatal care and delivered the infant at a hunting camp in Cross City. Yesterday she told the medical team in front of her current boyfriend that she was a surrogate and that the infant was not her biological child. She then told staff today she made up the story as she did not want her boyfriend to know the truth. She told the medical staff today she planned to give the infant to her sister in law at bedside. She did not convey this information to me. I met with Ms. [**NAME**] and her sister in law at bedside. She explained the baby was a result of a drunken one night stand and that she did not know how far along she was as she thought the baby would be delivered in February. She did not indicate any plans to give the infant to her sister in law.   She has been dating her boyfriend named [**NAME**] for the past year. They live in [**LOCATION_CITY**] with her two children ages 1 and 2. She stated they have a 2 bedroom home and that Mr. [**NAME**] works at TB Landmark laying pipe. She is a stay at home mother. She expressed she does not receive Medicaid as the case was closed and does not have WIC. She voiced the other children are followed by [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] Pediatrics in [**LOCATION_CITY**]. When exploring her lack of prenatal care she voiced she didn't get around to it as she was moving. She voiced initially there has never been a history of drug use of child protective services involvement. She later stated that DCF was involved as she tested positive for drugs at her last child's birth, but cannot remember what drugs. Per chart screening she tested positive for crystal meth at her last delivery in [**DATE**] and stated it was a one time use. She was not drug tested this delivery.   Ms. [**NAME**] described adequate preparation for the infant's care. She is breast feeding and planned to change to bottle feedings. She stated plans to use broth control pills. She voiced the father of her other two children was abusive and is not involved or supportive. Mr. [**NAME**] and her other two children are currently at the [**LOCATION_OTHER**] Hunting Camp at [**LOCATION_STREET**] in Cross City with plans to stay there through this week.  I explained the plan to contact the Florida Abuse Hotline based on the concerns of a lack of prenatal care and prior drug use. I am also concerned about the various reports of plans for this infant and Ms. [**NAME**] did not indicate to me a plan to give the infant to her sister in law. Ms. [**NAME**] presents as a poor historian and has frequent changes in her explanations to staff. The report was accepted at the Florida Abuses Hotline by Alphonso ID# [**ID**]. Please do not discharge this infant prior to contacting social work services for the discharge plan.
