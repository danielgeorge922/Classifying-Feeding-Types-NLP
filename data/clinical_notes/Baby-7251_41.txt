Lactation Note: mom states that the baby breast fed for 15 minutes on the left breast but the baby had difficulty breast on the right breast because the nipple is inverted. Upon my assessment the right nipple is not inverted and I was able to latch the baby onto the left breast after massaging the breast and teaching how to do hand expression. The baby stayed on the right breast 15 minutes. Mom did a lot of skin to skin and reports she wants to go to sleep now. I swaddled the baby and gave the baby to grandma. Mom instructed to breast feed on demand and allow the baby to stay on the breast until he is not doing any nutritive sucking. Grandma requested a pacifier and I made her aware of the risk of using a pacifier and she insisted that the FOB wants the baby to have a pacifier. In the meantime the FOB was sleeping and the MOB kept quiet. Upon my assessment of the baby's mouth the baby does have tight frenulum;however, the baby was able to maintain a good latch. The baby starts out chomping,then goes into a rhythmic suck. Mom encouraged to call her nurse if she needs any help with latching the baby.
