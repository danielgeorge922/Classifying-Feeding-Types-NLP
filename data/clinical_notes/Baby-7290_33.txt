Pt was complete and pushing.  Spontaneous delivery of a viable female infant followed.  Cord was doubly clamped and cut, after which infant was placed skin-to-skin on mother's chest.  Cord gas and DNA samples were collected.  Spontaneous delivery of the placenta followed with gentle cord traction and suprapubic pressure.  Vigorous fundal massage was performed and pitocin started.  The vagina, cervix, and perineum were carefully inspected for lacerations, but none were noted.  Prior to delivery a small lesion was noted on the left mons pubis, and the decision was made to remove this.  After pt was stable following delivery, attention was turned to this lesion.  5cc of lidocaine were placed subcutaneously.  The lesion was elevated with forcepts and removed at its base with scissors.  It was placed in a container to be sent to pathology.  The bleeding was controlled with pressure and covered with steri-strips.  Fundus was firm and pt stable prior to leaving the room.  Was a resident involved in this service?
