Ms. [**NAME**] reported painful contractions to the mother baby nurses and therefore was brought to labor and delivery for NST and cervical check.  When I spoke with the patient she is reporting contractions and wanting to "just go home".  She declined a cervical exam and "just wants to sleep".  She denies vaginal bleeding, LOF and decreased fetal movement.    NST: 130s, modBTBV, + accels, - decels Toco: q 5 min  I offered nubain for pain control as her tracing is reassuring and reactive and she reports no change in her contractions from previously.  Will give nubain x 1. Okay to transfer back to [**NAME**], MD
