Ovaries and tubes were not visualized. Liveborn infant male weighing 3764 grams with Apgars of 9 and 9.  SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY: Placenta   INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 31 y.o. female para 1001 at 38 weeks. She was undergoing induction secondary to a history of polyhydramnios that had required amnioreduction. She progressed to 9 cm and did not dilate further. The fetal heart tracing showed repetitive deep variable decelerations to the 60s. She did not have adequate contractions but the pitocin could not be titrated secondary to the fetal heart tracing.   DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfannenstiel incision. The incision was taken down to the level of the fascia which was incised in the midline. The incision was extended laterally in either direction over the rectus muscles. The fascia was dissected off the rectus muscle superiorly and then inferiorly. The rectus muscle was divided bluntly. The peritoneum was entered in a clear space sharply.  A bladder flap was created.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with the surgeon's fingers.  The amniotic fluid was clear.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood was obtained for analysis. Cord blood collection was performed.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.  The uterus was not exteriorized.  The uterine incision was closed in two layers, the first a locking suture of 0-vicryl and the second a running, imbricating suture of 0-vicryl. Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision, posterior to the bladder, and in the subfascial area.  The fascia was closed with two sutures of 0 Vicryl beginning from either end of the incision and meeting in the midportion.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and re-approximated with a running suture of 0-chromic.  The skin was closed with a running subcuticular closure of 4-0 Monocryl.  Dermabond was applied to the incision.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.
