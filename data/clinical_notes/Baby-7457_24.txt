CHTN w/ SI Severe PreE: Currently on magnesium with BPs elevated (possibly with a component of pain) to 110-140s/50-70s. Patient asymptomatic with benign physical exam. Elevated liver enzymes with recent panel as above. Hepatitis panel pending as patient also with a history of drug abuse.  2. IOL: Currently on pitocin at 14 mu. GBS positive on Vancomycin to cover both GBS and MRSA 3. MRSA: Weeping abscess on back. Currently on vancomycin. Cultures pending. On contact precautions.   Plan:  1. Continue magnesium for seizure prophylaxis 2. Continue pitocin per protocol. If not cervical change in 2 hours with documented adequate contractions via IUPC, will proceed with cesarean section for arrest of dilation.  3. Continue vancomycin for GBS and MRSA.  4. If BPs remain elevated despite adequate pain control, will treat with IV vs po antihypertensives as needed.  6. F/u hepatitis panel.  7. CEFM x 2. CTM.  [**NAME**], MD
