I went to evaluate the patient as she was reporting feeling dizzy.  The nurse obtained her blood pressure and reported it to be 132/28.  The patient denies chest pain, SOB, back pain, palpitations and presyncope/syncope.    Filed Vitals:   [**DATE**] 1259 [**DATE**] 1310 [**DATE**] 1332 [**DATE**] 1340  BP: 138/28 138/32  130/53  Pulse:   85   Temp:      TempSrc:      Resp:      Height:      Weight:      SpO2:   95%     Gen: NAD,alert and oriented Heart: RRR Lungs : clear to auscultation bilaterally  Abdomen: soft, gravid, nontender Ext: nontender, no edema bilaterally   A: 28 yo P2002 at 23 weeks gestation with Type III dissection trasnferred from CT surgery for ob management.  I spoke with the CT surgery PA about the patients current symptoms and blood pressures.  This wide pulse pressure is likely a response to the multiple BP meds she is taking.  Plan per CT surgery is to decrease antihypertensive dosing and change BP parameters to < 140 systolic.   P:  1) pending specific recs from CT surgery  2) continue to monitor closely  [**NAME**], MD
