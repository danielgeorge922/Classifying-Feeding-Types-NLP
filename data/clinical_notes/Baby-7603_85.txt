DOB: [**DATE**]   Admit date: [**DATE**] Admitting Physician: [**NAME**], MD  Discharge Physician:   Hospital Course: Ms. [**NAME**] was a 32 yo P3103 who was admitted on [**DATE**] at 33 weeks  with PPROM. She was started on magnesium for tocolysis, PPROM, and betamethasone course. Secondary to nonreassuring fetal heart tracing, IOL was started with pitocin once patient was status post betamethasone injections. Patient again started having repetitive variable decelerations despite amnioinfusion and vaginal bleeding, concerning for abruption. The decision was made to proceed with induction and trial of vaginal delivery as the fetal heart rate tracing was overall reassuring. Shortly after patient had her first episode of bleeding (see notes for more details), she was found to be completely dilated and went on to deliver a liveborn infant male, weighing 2078 g with Apgars of 9 and 9. Following delivery, patient had a postpartum hemorrhage requiring manual extraction of clots from LUS, a total of 40 units of pitocin, and misoprostol 1000 mg per rectum. Hct went from 38.2 --> 32.9, platelets were stable, and coags wnl. Her bleeding eventually stopped and her fundus remained firm. On PPD#2, she was discharged home as she was with minimal vaginal bleeding, with good pain control, tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, and voiding spontaneously. She is to followup with Women's Health Group at [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] [**LOCATION_OTHER**] in 4-6 weeks for routine postpartum visit.
