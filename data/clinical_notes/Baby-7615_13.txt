Procedure: After satisfactory anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped in a routine fashion for abdominal surgery.  Time-out confirmed patient and procedure.  The abdomen was entered with a pfannensteil approach.  A bladder flap was created and then a transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and extended laterally with the surgeon's fingers.  Amniotic fluid was clear.  The above described infant A was delivered from the Breech presentation.  The cord was clamped after 30 seconds and cut and the baby handed to the pediatrician.  Blood for gases and DNA was obtained.  The above described infant B was delivered from the Cephalic presentation.  The cord was clamped after 30 seconds and cut and the baby handed to the pediatrician.  Blood for gases and DNA was obtained. The placenta was delivered with cord traction.  The uterus was wiped out with a lap.  The uterus was closed in a single layer closure using 0-vicrly.   The right fallopian tube was identified by the fimbria, double ligated with 0-chromic suture and the intervening segment excised.  The left fallopian tube was identified by the fimbria, double ligated with 0-chromic suture and the intervening segment excised.    The fascia was closed with 1 suture of 0-Vicryl starting at the angle and running in a continuous fashion. The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated.  The skin was closed with 4-0 polysorb.  Steri strips and a bandage were applied.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.
