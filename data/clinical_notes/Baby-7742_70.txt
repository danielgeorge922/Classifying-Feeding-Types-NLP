I was notified by the nursing staff that Ms. [**NAME**] would like to be discharged now.  She reports that she would liek to leave AMA.  She is very anxious reporting a history of anxiety in addition to a sick 19 month old child at home.  She states a family member is taking care of that child but that family member has the flu and her child now has a temp.  I discussed her elevated blood pressure may be an indication of postpartum preeclampsia and we would like to provide further observation and work up.  We discuseed the risk of stroke, hemorrhage, organ injury and seizures.  She understands this but declines evaluation and would like to go home. An AMA form was signed and witnessed.    I have eprescribed a prescription for micronor postpartum in addition to tamiflu prophylaxis secondary to sick family members.   The NICU should be informed and the patient will contact her pediatrician for her son.    She will follow up in 1 week in my clinic for a blood pressure check.   Of note, the patient left the unit prior to an order and written discharge instructions could be typed or given to the patient. I did give verbal precautions during my discussion  [**NAME**], MD
