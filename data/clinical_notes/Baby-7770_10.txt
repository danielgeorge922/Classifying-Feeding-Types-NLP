Date of Surgery: [**DATE**]  PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  1) Intrauterine pregnancy at 39 weeks 4 days 2) Prior LTCS x 1 2) Undesired fertility  POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  1) Intrauterine pregnancy at 39 weeks 4 days 2) Repeat low transverse cesarean section 3) Undesired fertility  PROCEDURE:  1) Low transverse cesarean section 2) Parkland postpartum bilateral tubal interruption  SURGEON: [**NAME**] MD ASSISTANT: [**NAME**] MD  ANESTHESIOLOGIST: [**NAME**] MD ANESTHESIA ASSISTANT: [**NAME**] MD  ANESTHESIA: Spinal  EBL: 300 mL  FLUID REPLACEMENT: 2300 mL  FINDINGS: Normal uterus, tubes and ovaries bilaterally.  Liveborn infant female weighing 3697 grams with Apgars of 7 and 9.  SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY:  Segments from each tube  INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 31 y.o. female para 1001 who presented for scheduled repeat cesarean section. She had a prior LTCS x 1 and declined a trial of labor after cesarean section.   DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfanenstiel incision.  A bladder flap was not created.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with traction.  The amniotic fluid was clear.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood was obtained for analysis.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap x 2.  The uterus was exteriorized, and the uterine incision was closed in two layers, the first a running suture of 0 Vicryl and the second a running, imbricating suture of 0 Monocryl.    The right fallopian tube was identified to its fimbriated end and a defect was made in a relatively avascular portion of the mesosalpinx underlying the mid isthmic portion of the tube.  A segment of the mid isthmic portion of the tube was ligated with two sutures of 1 Plain Gut suture and the intervening portion of the tube excised and handed off the field; adequate hemostasis was assured.  The exact same procedure was performed on the opposite side after identifying that tube to its fimbriated end; again, adequate hemostasis was assured.  The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity.  Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision and in the subfascial area.  The fascia was re-approximated with one suture of 0 Vicryl beginning from one corner of the incision and running to the opposite corner.  The subcutaneous tissue was not reapproximated due to subcutaneous tissue with depth less than 1 cm.  The skin was closed with a running subcuticular closure of 3-0 Monocryl.  Benzoin, Steri-Strips, and a sterile dressing were applied to the incision.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.
