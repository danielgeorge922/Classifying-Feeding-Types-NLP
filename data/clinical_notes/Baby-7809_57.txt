Patient seen with c/o raised erythematous patch over lumbar region. Patient states a similar thing happened following prior epidural. Patient in no obvious discomfort, itching controlled with PRN 25mg benadryl PRN. Rash is raised, erythematous and warm to the touch. The shape suggests patient has contact dermatitis to the chlorahexadine skin prep used or the dye added to the skin prep. Patient afebrile, hemodynamically stable and neurologically intact so no concern for infection at this time.   Agree with benadryl prn. Will write for steroid cream. Edges marked with skin marker to follow improvement on AM rounds.
