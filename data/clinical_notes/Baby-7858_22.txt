SW had no initial concerns as MOB has the support of FOB ([**NAME**]) and reported all baby needs met.  However, while speaking with MOB, she stated that she named baby "[**NAME**]" after her mother who passed away last year.  MOB then began to cry.  SW provided support and talked with MOB about how the joy of having a baby can sometimes bring pain especially because it was her mother who passed away. SW educated MOB about post-partum depression and talked with her about her increased risk because of the recent death of her mother. MOB declined referral for Healthy Start at this time, but SW informed her that she could request a referral from baby's pediatrician if she finds she needs to access their free counseling program.    MOB also reported experiencing stress because she is caring for baby in hospital room alone as FOB is at home with the couples' daughter (age 3).  MOB stated she is trying to breast feed for the first time and it is not going well.  SW encouraged MOB to request help from nurse and lactation consultant as MOB stated baby is hurting her breasts.  SW also encouraged her to do what is best for her and her baby.    SW spoke with MOB's nurse and requested that she provide breastfeeding support and some help with baby as FOB is unable to be here today.    SW returned to check on MOB later in the day and she was sleeping.    SW will check in on MOB tomorrow (Saturday).
