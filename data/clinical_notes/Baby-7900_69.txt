Late entry:   NICU fellow Dr [**NAME**] found me on L&D to discuss baby boy Hanif's status. Dr [**NAME**] relayed that the baby is breathing on his own but has demonstrated seizure-like activity and is now on the cooling protocol. He suspects HIE and planned to give Ms [**NAME**] an update, but invited our team to go as well.   Dr [**NAME**] and myself accompanied Dr [**NAME**] to the patient's room while he informed Ms [**NAME**] and her husband of the baby's status.   We answered her OB-related questions and offered our support.   [**NAME**], MD
