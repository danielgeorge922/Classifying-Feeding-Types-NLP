Date of Surgery: [**DATE**]  Preoperative Diagnosis:  1) 40 weeks  2) Arrest of dilation  3) Chorioamnionitis  Postoperative Diagnosis: Same   Operation Performed: Primary Low Transverse Cesarean Section  Surgeon: [**NAME**]  Assistant: [**NAME**]   Anesthesiologist: [**NAME**]  Anesthesiology Assistant: [**NAME**]  Anesthesia: Spinal   Pathology: Placenta   EBL: 800 ml  Findings: Normal uterus, tubes and ovaries bilaterally.  Liveborn infant female weighing 3456 grams with Apgars of 8 and 9.  Indication: [**NAME**] is a 26 y.o. female para 0 who was admitted with spontaneous rupture of membranes at 3/C/-1. She was started on pitocin and progressed to 5/C/0 but did not progress further despite adequate uterine contractions on pitocin. She developed chorioamnionitis and was started on antibiotics. After 5 hours of no cervical change she was agreeable to delivery via cesarean section.   Procedure: After satisfactory anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped in a routine fashion for abdominal surgery.  Time-out confirmed patient and procedure.  The abdomen was entered with a Pfannensteil approach.  A bladder flap was created and then a transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and extended laterally with the surgeon's fingers.  Amniotic fluid was cloudy white.  The above described infant was delivered from the cephalic presentation.  The cord was clamped and cut and the baby handed to the pediatrician.  Blood for gases and DNA was obtained.  The placenta was delivered with cord traction.  The uterus was wiped out with a lap.  The uterus was closed in a double layer closure using 0-monocryl. The first layer was sewn in a running locked fashion from angle to angle. The second layer was an imbricating layer sewn across the hysterotomy. The fascia was closed with 1 suture of 0-Vicryl starting at the angle and running in a continuous fashion. The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and reapproximated with a single running stitch of 3-0 vicryl.  The skin was closed with 4-0 monocryl in an intracuticular fashion.  Steristrips (without benzoin) were applied and an OpSite dressing was applied.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.  [**NAME**]  Dictated for [**NAME**] MD  I was present for the entire case.
