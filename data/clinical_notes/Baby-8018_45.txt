She was given a bolus of fluid due to concern for possible dehydration.  Contractions began increasing in frequency and patient was admitted for TOLAC.  There were some variable decels on FHT so patient was consented for Cesarean if needed.  Labor progressed appropriately and patient began pushing with repetitive variable decels during pushing with recovery to baseline without overshooting.  Forceps were opened in preparation but were not needed as patient delivered spontaneously with use of Ritgen maneuver.  Healthy baby boy was passed to Peds for evaluation due to numerous decels during labor; APGARs 9 and 9.  Patient had a normal post-partum course.  She was uncomfortable with pain on postpartum day 1 so remained for observation and management.  She is currently adequately pain controlled, breast feeding well, urinating well, and has no other concerns.  She desired Yaz OCP for birth control but was agreeable to progesterone-only contraceptive after learning of possible effects on breast milk production with estrogen contraceptives.
