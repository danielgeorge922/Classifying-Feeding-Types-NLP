Pt found resting in bed, laying with baby. Pt appears tearful, and reports feeling very tired because "she hasn't slept in 5 days." Pt complaining of pain 6/10 in her abdomen. Administered PRN Oxycodone 10 mg with morning medications. Encouraged Pt to keep baby under the phototherapy for as much as possible today. Placed baby under bili light on bili blanket, but baby was showing signs of hunger and Mom took the baby off to try to feed him. Assisted mom with breastfeeding and encouraged her to help the baby latch deeply. Baby unable to get a good latch for more than 5 or 10 seconds. Encouraged mom to keep trying using the demonstrated techniques. Will follow up on pain and continue to monitor.
