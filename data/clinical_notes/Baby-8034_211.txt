Lactation Note: mom states that the baby is hungry all the time. She does not she feels like she has enough milk. And she is supplementing with 20 ml of Enfamil at every feed. She has been letting the baby wait every 3 hours because the baby needs to be under lights. Mom was reminded of the importance of breastfeeding on demand. When I walked the baby was acting famished he was seeking a nipple that was right in front of him. I hand expressed her milk and the baby latched but sucked a little and started crying and was agitated. I used a supplemental feeder at the breast with the 20 mls mom gives and the baby stayed on the left breast 15 minutes and took 8 mls of the supplement and he stayed on the right breast about 25 minutes + and finished the supplement via supplemental feeder. Mom instructed to continue to pump after breastfeeding for 10 minutes and hand express and she should supplement with her expressed milk. Mom appears tired and not focused. I told her that it was normal to feel sleepy during breastfeeding due to the oxytocin and she should try to sleep after she pumps. I was able to palpate a knot on the right lateral side of her right breast. Mom instructed to put a warm compress and pump after breastfeeding.  Mom has WIC and I referred her the Center for Breastfeeding. She demonstrated a good latch and positioning after I left and came back in the room to check on her. Breastfeeding d/c instructions given with a packet. Mom encouraged to call the office if she has any concerns.
