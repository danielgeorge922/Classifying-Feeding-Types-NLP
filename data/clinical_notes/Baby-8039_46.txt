Date of Surgery: [**DATE**]  PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  1) Intrauterine pregnancy at 41 weeks 2) Meconium stained fluid 3) Chorioamnionitis 4) Arrest of descent 5) Uterine atony  POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Same  PROCEDURE:  1) Primary Low transverse cesarean section  SURGEON: Dr. [**NAME**] ASSISTANT: Dr. [**NAME**]  ANESTHESIOLOGIST: Dr. [**NAME**] ANESTHESIA ASSISTANT: Dr. [**NAME**]  ANESTHESIA: Epidural  EBL: 1000 mL  FINDINGS: Normal uterus, tubes and ovaries bilaterally.  Liveborn infant male weighing 3052 grams with Apgars of 7 and 9.  SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY: placenta  INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 22 y.o. female para 0 at 41w2d who progressed to complete and developed chorioamnionitis.  She pushed for 3 hours with no change in descent and the decision was made to proceed with cesarean delivery  DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfanenstiel incision.  A bladder flap was created.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with bandage scissors.  The amniotic fluid was thick meconium stained.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood was obtained for analysis.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.  The uterus was exteriorized, and it was noted that there was a 3 cm extension on the left lateral edge of the hysterotomy.  It was closed separately with a running suture of 0-Monocryl.  Then, the uterine incision was closed in two layers, the first a running suture of 0 Monocryl and the second a running, imbricating suture of 0 Monocryl.    Atony was noted and additional 40 units of pitocin was administered.  Methergine was given x 1 and hemabate was given x 2, 15 minutes apart, one IM and one intrauterine.  Tone improved after the uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity.    Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision and in the subfascial area.  Additional figure of eight sutures were placed on the rectus muscle for hemostasis.  The fascia was closed with one suture of 0 Vicryl beginning from one end of the incision and running across.  The subcutaneous tissue was closed with a running suture of 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with a running subcuticular closure of 4-0 Polysorb.  Benzoin, Steri-Strips, and a sterile dressing were applied to the incision.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  1000 mcg of misoprostol was placed rectally at the end of the case.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.
