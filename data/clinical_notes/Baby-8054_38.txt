Date of Surgery: [**DATE**]  Preoperative Diagnosis:  1) IUP at 40 weeks  2) Polyhydramnios 3) Arrest of dilation  4) Failed induction of labor   Postoperative Diagnosis: Same   Operation Performed: Primary Low Transverse Cesarean Section  Surgeon: [**NAME**]  Assistant: [**NAME**]   Anesthesiologist: [**NAME**]  Anesthesiology Assistant: [**NAME**]   Anesthesia: Spinal   Pathology: Placenta   EBL: 1000 ml  Findings: Normal uterus, tubes and ovaries bilaterally.  Liveborn infant male weighing 4183 grams with Apgars of 9 and 9.  Indication: [**NAME**] is a 28 y.o. female para 0 who presented at 40 weeks for scheduled induction of labor for idiopathic polyhydramnios. She progressed to 5 cm but had no descent with fetal station at -3 and ballotable. She made no progress on pitocin for greater than 12 hours and was offered primary cesarean for failure to progress.   Procedure: After satisfactory anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped in a routine fashion for abdominal surgery.  Time-out confirmed patient and procedure.  The abdomen was entered with a Pfannensteil approach. The fascia was scored with a scalpel and cut laterally with curved mayo scissors. The fascia was dissected off the underlying muscle. The rectus muscles were separated and the peritoneum incised with Metzenbaum scissors. The peritoneum was stretched and a bladder blade placed in the lower aspect of the abdominal cavity to expose the lower uterine segment. The uterus was palpated and was found to be extremely dextrorotated.  A bladder flap was created and then a transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and extended laterally with the surgeon's fingers.  Amniotic fluid was copious and clear.  The above described infant was delivered from the vertex presentation with the aid of a Kiwi vacuum.  The cord was clamped and cut and the baby handed to the pediatrician.  Blood for gases and DNA was obtained.  The placenta was delivered with cord traction and sent to pathology.  The uterus was wiped out with a lap.  Uterine atony was diagnosed and 40 units of pitocin was started on a pressure bag with fundal massage. A B-Lynch stitch was placed in the usual fashion using #1 chromic gut suture and tied down. The uterus was closed in a double layer closure. The first stitch was a running, unlocked stitch of 0-vicryl. The second an imbricating layer of 0-vicryl.  The fascia was closed with 2 sutures of 0-Vicryl starting at the angle and running in a continuous fashion to meet at midline. The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and reapproximated with a running stitch of 3-0 vicryl.  The skin was closed with a running intracuticular stitch of 3-0 monocryl.  Steristrips and a sterile dressing were applied.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.
