Late Entry: RN has discussed with patient and FOB Q 30 min about increasing Pitocin by 2 milli-units at each 30 min interval to assist patient with reaching complete dilation. Patient repeatedly refused increase, preferring to leave Pitocin infusing at current rate of 21 mill-units. Patient stated that she was not coping well with contractions. Discussed POC with patient and FOB, including option of AROM to potentially assist with dilation. Patient declines at this time.
