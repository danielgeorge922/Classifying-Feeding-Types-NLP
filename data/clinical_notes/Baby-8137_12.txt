Liveborn infant male weighing 2700 grams with Apgars of 9 and 9.  Indication: [**NAME**] is a 28 y.o. female para 0111 who presented at 35 weeks with complaints of back pain and was found to be in preterm labor. Her cervix was 4 cm 90% and given prior myomectomy she was taken for cesarean delivery.   Procedure: After satisfactory anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped in a routine fashion for abdominal surgery.  Time-out confirmed patient and procedure.  The abdomen was entered with a Pfannensteil approach using the prior transverse abdominal incision.  A bladder flap was not created and then a transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and extended laterally with the surgeon's fingers.  Amniotic fluid was clear.  The above described infant was delivered from the cephalic presentation.  The cord was clamped and cut and the baby handed to the pediatrician.  Blood for gases and DNA was obtained.  The placenta was delivered with cord traction.  The uterus was wiped out with a lap.  The uterus was closed in a double layer closure using 0-vicryl.  The first layer was ran in an unlocking, continuous fashion and the second was an imbricating layer.  Thin filmy adhesions between the uterine fundus and omentum were taken down with Bovie cautery.  The fascia was closed with a running suture of 0-Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and reapproximated with a running stitch of 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with a running intracuticular stitch of 3-0 Monocryl.  Steristrips were applied.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.  [**NAME**]  Dictated for [**NAME**] MD   I was present for the entire case.
