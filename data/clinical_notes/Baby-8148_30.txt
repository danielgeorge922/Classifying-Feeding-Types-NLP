Fetal head was delivered and restituted to right but anterior shoulder was unable to be delivered due to poor maternal effort despite encouragement and instruction to push.  Language barrier possibly contributed.  McRoberts position, suprapubic pressure, and collapsing of posterior arm across fetal chest allowed for delivery of anterior shoulder.  Patient has had a normal post-partum course.  Adequate pain control, minimal vaginal bleeding, bowel and bladder working well, breast feeding well.  No concerns about baby.  Patient received Depo shot on PPD#1 and plans for Mirena IUD as outpatient.   Follow-up with Women's Health in 4 weeks  [**NAME**] [**DATE**] 7:17 AM
