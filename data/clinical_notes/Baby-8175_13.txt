Pt called for RN stating she "couldn't take anymore" & wanted an epidural.  Anes was notified.  Anes was in OR on a case & couldn't come to BS right away.  Decreased pitocin to 8mu/min for pt comfort until epidural was placed.  When anes came to BS pt was positioned & epidural was placed without difficulty.  Pt denied side effects of test dose & tolerated the procedure very well.  She now rates pain 0/10 & is sleeping.
