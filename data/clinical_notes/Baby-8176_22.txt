Obstetrics Operative Report   Date of Surgery: [**DATE**]  PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  1) Intrauterine pregnancy at 34 weeks 5 days 2) PPROM 3) Nonreassuring FHT 4) Suspected placental abruption  POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Sam + confirmed placental abruption  PROCEDURE:  1) Stat primary low transverse cesarean section  SURGEON: [**NAME**] ASSISTANT: [**NAME**]  ANESTHESIOLOGIST: [**NAME**] ANESTHESIA ASSISTANT: [**NAME**]  ANESTHESIA: GETA  EBL: 1000 mL  FLUID REPLACEMENT: 3000 mL  FINDINGS: 2 small (1-3cm) pedunculated fibroids on anterior uterus. Normal tubes and ovaries bilaterally with exception of small bilateral paratubal cysts.  Liveborn infant female weighing 2151grams with Apgars of 8 and 9.  SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY: placenta  INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 24 y.o. female para 1001 who presented with PPROM at 34w5d. Was started on pitocin to augment labor and progressed to 6 cm but began to have repetitive decelerations and noted to have approx 150-200cc blood out with clots suspicious for abruption. Decision was made to proceed to OR for cesarean delivery. Developed more persistent bradycardia en route to OR and proceeded to stat cesarean.   DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfannenstiel incision. The incision was taken down to the level of the fascia which was incised in the midline. The incision was extended laterally in either direction over the rectus muscles. The fascia was dissected off the rectus muscle superiorly and then inferiorly. The rectus muscle was divided bluntly. The peritoneum was entered in a clear space bluntly.  A bladder flap was not created.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with the surgeon's fingers.  The amniotic fluid was clear.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood was obtained for analysis.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.  The uterus was exteriorized, and the uterine incision was closed in 2 layers, the first a running, locking suture of 0-vicryl and the second a running, imbricating suture of 0-vicryl.  The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity.  Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision, posterior to the bladder, and in the subfascial area.  The fascia was closed with one suture of 0 Vicryl beginning from either one of the incision and running continuously.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and did not require re-approximation.  The skin was closed with a running subcuticular closure of 3-0 monocryl.  Benzoin, Steri-Strips, and a sterile dressing were applied to the incision.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.  [**NAME**], MD  Dictated for Dr. [**NAME**]
