Suspect severe range BPs are secondary to worsening CHTN as patient is asymptomatic, physical exam benign, and elevated Cr likely secondary to dehydration. Also, patient with baseline proteinuria with elevated 24 hr urine protein at 562, baseline 1-2+ proteinuria in clinic, and Pr:Cr ratio in the grey zone today at 338. Although patient can always develop Preeclampsia, do not suspect PrE at this time and will hold off on magnesium and start if BPs are not reasonably well controlled with oral meds and remain persistently elevated, patient becomes symptomatic, or for worsening labs. Repeat labs ordered for 0930 this morning and then BID.  Will start insulin gtt if BG >95.   Cervix remains unchanged at 1-[**DATE**]. Thus, for induction, will attempt to place foley bulb and start pitocin. If foley bulb unable to be placed, will just start pitocin. Will consent patient for TOLAC, C/S, Hysterectomy, and blood products. Patient declines BTI.    Discussed with Dr. [**NAME**] and Dr. [**NAME**], MD
