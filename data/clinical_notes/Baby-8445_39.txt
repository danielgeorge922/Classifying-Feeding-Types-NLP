Procedure: After satisfactory anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped in a routine fashion for abdominal surgery.  Time out confirmed the patient and procedure.  The abdomen was entered with a transverse incision below the umbilicus.  The right fallopian tube was identified by the fimbria, double ligated with plain gut suture and the intervening segment excised.  The left fallopian tube was not identified by the fimbria as adhesive disease was noted, double ligated with plain gut suture and the intervening segment excised.  Ligated portion was confirmed as fallopian tube by insertion of chromic suture through the tube.  The fascia was closed with a running suture of O-Vicryl.  The skin was closed with a subcuticular stitch of Polysorb.  Dermabond applied.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in satisfactory condition.     [**NAME**], MD
