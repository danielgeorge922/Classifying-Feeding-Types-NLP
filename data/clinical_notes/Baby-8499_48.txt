P0 at 35w0d with a history of T2DM on glyburide and gestational hypertension and DM who had been monitored on L&D for variable decels in her clinic NST a couple days prior.  Tracing had been moderate variability with occasional variable decels until evening of [**DATE**] when variability decreased.  A biophysical profile was performed and was [**DATE**] (2 points off for breathing and 2 points off for movement). Delivery was indicated and while discussing possible route of delivery with the patient, she had a prolonged deceleration and was transported to the OR.  In the OR FHTs were in the 130s with moderate variability.  At that time cesarean delivery was recommended because of suspected fetal intolerance of labor very remote from delivery.  Because of the normal FHR at that time, it was determined that there was time to establish regional anesthesia and reduce maternal aspiration risks, and anesthesia placed a spinal in less than 5 minutes and we proceeded rapidly with cesarean delivery.  DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfannenstiel incision. The incision was taken down to the level of the fascia which was incised in the midline. The incision was extended laterally in either direction over the rectus muscles. The fascia was dissected off the rectus muscle superiorly and then inferiorly. The rectus muscle was divided bluntly. The peritoneum was entered in a clear space sharply.  A bladder flap was not created.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with the surgeon's fingers and bandage scissors.  The amniotic fluid was clear.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation.  Delayed cord clamping was considered, however there was little blood in the umbilical cord and the baby was limp so the cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting NICU 111 team. A sample of cord and cord blood was obtained for analysis.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.  The uterus was exteriorized, and the uterine incision was closed in 2 layers, the first a running suture of 0-Vicryl and the second a running, imbricating suture of 0-Vicryl.   The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity.  Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision, posterior to the bladder, and in the subfascial area.  The fascia was closed with one suture of 0 Vicryl beginning at one end of the incision and running to the other.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and re-approximated with a running suture of 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with a running subcuticular closure of 3-0 Monocryl. Dermabond was applied to the incision. The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.
