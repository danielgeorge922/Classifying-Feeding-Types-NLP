I went and talked to patient about her concerns: restarting the pitocin and fetal intolerance to labor, her being tired of being induced.  I explained that Dr. [**NAME**] and I would recommend continuing to try to proceed with induction at this time as the FHT is reassuring and that we try to prevent the first cesarean delivery when at all possible.  I acknowledged her concern about fetal well being and I explained that if there is evidence of intolerance to labor with no cervical change, we would go ahead and proceed with cesarean delivery but performing a cesarean at this time does not seem indicated.  Cesarean is not without maternal risks and with future pregnancies she may need repeat cesarean deliveries which would also not be without increasing maternal risks (infection, bleeding, injury to internal organs, etc).  She expressed understanding and is willing to proceed with one more trial of restarting pitocin.  [**NAME**], RN present for discussion.  [**NAME**] MD
