Two of MOB's daughters were in the room and MOB stated that she was comfortable with them staying during SW assessment.  MOB's records reflect early and consistent prenatal care beginning at 12 weeks. She attended 9 visits. MOB stated she actually went to her initial visit at North FL at 8 weeks.   MOB reported that she has support from FOB ([**NAME**]) and from MOB's mother and brother who live close by.  MOB reported that she lives with FOB and their 3 children.    MOB reported that she has everything she needs for baby, including clothes, diapers, car seat, and bassinet/crib.  MOB reported that she has no problems with transportation and plans to take baby to [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] for pediatric care. MOB reported that she is enrolled in WIC and Food Stamps.  SW talked with MOB about her methadone use. MOB reported that she was in a car accident about 7 years ago and became addicted to the pain medication she was given. She stated that she asked her doctor what to do when she realized she was addicted and she was told to go to a methadone clinic. MOB stated she wishes she was told to go through the week of hell for detox, instead of getting on methadone for 6 years (!). MOB stated that she has always been compliant at [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] and had no problem with signing the Authorization to Request Protected Health Information from Other Providers so that SW can follow-up with Meridian. SW will have to follow-up on Tuesday.   SW was previously made aware by nurse that MOB stopped nurse from giving her methadone, stating "I have my own methadone with me." Some confusion may have occurred concerning this situation. MOB stated that when she arrived on L&D, before she delivered her baby, MOB informed her nurse that she had her own prescription of methadone and would not need the medical staff to give her any doses. MOB stated no one made a big deal out of this and she took her medication as prescribed. When MOB arrived on the Mother-Baby Unit, MOB stated that she expected that she would continue taking her own medication. SW explained to MOB that her MBU nurse was following hospital protocol. SW explained that patients are not allowed to take their own medications (even ibuprofen or Tylenol) because of the danger of getting double doses. MOB stated she now understands. SW thanked MOB for her honesty about having her own medication with her.   To be clear, MOB did not take a double dose of methadone. She was honest about taking her own medication and refused the medication so she would not be double dosed.  During this assessment, SW observed MOB and her daughters caring for and bonding with baby. SW also observed MOB appropriately disciplining her daughters (who are very well behaved and clean).   SW educated MOB about SIDS, Back to Sleep, Shaken Baby Syndrome, protecting baby from 2nd and 3rd-hand smoke, and Post-Partum Depression.  SW needs to contact Meridian to verify MOB's participation and compliance with the Methadone Clinic. Please contact SW before baby's discharge.
