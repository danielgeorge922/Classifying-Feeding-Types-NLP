Her exam at that time was 5/C/BB. The suture had not pulled through. She was given a 1000cc bolus of LR and her magnesium was increased gradually to 4, but her contractions persisted and increased in intensity. Repeat exam showed increased bloody mucous on perineum and the cervix was 6/C/BB. The suture had not pulled through, but she stated that she could not bear the pain any longer. The decision was made to place an epidural and remove the patient's cerclage. The patient was transported to the operating room where an epidural was placed. The NICU team was assembled in the operating room. She was then examined and the cervix was noted to be C/C/BB to introitus. The suture could not be palpated. The patient began spontaneously pushing and the baby was delivered en caul. The baby was removed from the amniotic sac, the umbilical cord doubly clamped and cut, and the baby was handed off to the neonatology team waiting in the room to begin resuscitation.  Pitocin IV infusion was started. The patient's vagina and cervix were examined. The cerclage remained in place. The cerclage knot at 12 o'clock was grasped with a Kelly, elevated, cut, and removed intact. The patient's cervix was examined again and no lacerations were noted. There were no vaginal lacerations.  The delivery was reviewed with the patient and the FOB. They understand that the baby will be cared for by the NICU team.   Was a resident involved in this service?
