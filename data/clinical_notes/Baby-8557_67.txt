P1001 who had a vaginal delivery complicated by a mild shoulder dystocia. She was found to have at least a third degree laceration immediately postpartum, but was taken to the operating room for further diagnosis and repair with the aid of optimal anesthesia, lighting, and positioning   DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in low lithotomy position and her abdomen and legs were prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  An exam under anesthesia was performed, confirming the fourth degree perineal laceration. The rectal mucosa was re-approximated with a running suture of 4-0 Vicryl. The rectal submucosal tissue was re-approximated with a running suture of 3-0 Vicryl. The muscle of the external anal sphincter and the overlying supporting capsule were re-approximated with interrupted sutures of 2-0 Vicryl placed through the capsule.  Attention was then turned to the right sulcal laceration, which was repaired with a running, locked suture of 3-0 Vicryl. Finally, the 2nd degree perineal laceration was repaired in the usual fashion with a running suture of 3-0 Vicryl.  A rectal examination was performed, and no suture or defects were palpable.  A Foley catheter was placed in her bladder.  All counts were correct at the end of procedure. The patient was taken down from low lithotomy position and transferred to the recovery room in good condition.  [**NAME**], MD  Dictated for Dr. [**NAME**]   I was present for the entire case.
