This was reviewed with the patient at delivery and again on postpartum rounds the next morning. Her postpartum course was remarkable for some residual left lower extremity weakness and numbness. She was evaluated by anesthesia and neurology and had negative MRI with no evidence of epidural hematoma. She was seen PPD#2 by physical therapy and able to ambulate with minimal assistance and her symptoms gradually improve. Her symptoms were felt to be likely due to positional changes and prolonged second stage of labor with possible nerve compression and should be transient in nature.
