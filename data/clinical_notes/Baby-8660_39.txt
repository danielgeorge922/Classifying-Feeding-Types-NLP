Currently refusing IM Hemabate. Dr. [**NAME**] and myself at bedside to explain that at this time we are strongly recommending pt to accept IM Hemabate.  Pt states "I am refusing  this now because am stressed about everything and I feel fine." Pt states she thinks this medicine is going to make her bleeding worse. Pt states she "does not want any more medicine.  She understands that she could continue to bleed and that this could result in continued post partum hemorrhage which could result in need to go to OR with Bakri balloon placement and if she continues to bleed, possible hysterectomy.Pt continuing to resfuse intervention at this time.   Family is at bedside attempting to reason with pt to accept recommended medication  At this time will give additional 20 units of IV pitocin Will also draw CBC, Coags STAT to assess Will ctm urine output hourly.
