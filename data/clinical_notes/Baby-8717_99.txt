Pt received to my care at 1530. Report received from [**LOCATION_CITY**] RN. Pt OOB sitting in chair with infant in arms. She is using a nipple shield to feed baby at present as her right nipple is reddened and the left nipple is flat (according to pt). I assessed pt's nipples and hand expressed very little colostrum. I suggested a breast pump for extra stimulation and mother welcomed this additional help. Breast pump set up and I demonstrated to mother how to use it. She will be pumping every three hours. Husband at bedside and actively involved in baby care and support of mother.
