Liveborn infant male weighing 1697 grams with Apgars of 8 and 9. Liveborn infant male weighing 1535 grams with Apgars of 8 and 9.   SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY: Placenta   INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 27 y.o. female para 2032 with a history of di/di twin pregnancy who was admitted in preterm labor. She received a steroid course and was transferred to the floor. Tonight, she began having contractions for about 20 minutes and was brought to Labor and Delivery and found to be completely dilated. She desired delivery via cesarean. Given rapid progression decision was made with anesthesia team to proceed with general anesthesia.  DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  The patient was placed in the dorsal supine position and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning. General anesthesia was then administered.  The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfannensteil incision. The incision was taken down to the level of the fascia which was incised in the midline. The incision was extended laterally in either direction over the rectus muscles.  The rectus muscle was divided bluntly. The peritoneum was entered in a clear space bluntly.  A bladder flap was not created.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with the surgeon's fingers. Immediately 500cc blood clot was found in the uterus consistant with an acute placental abruption. The amniotic fluid was bloody . The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. The second amniotic sac was ruptured with clear fluid. The second twin was delivered from the breech presentation. The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood was obtained for analysis from both cords.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.  The uterus was exteriorized, and the uterine incision was closed in two layers, the first a locking suture of 0-Vicryl and the second a running, imbricating suture of 0-vicryl. Hemostasis was achieved with a figure of eight suture of 3-0 vicryl.  The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity.  Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision, posterior to the bladder, and in the subfascial area. The muscle was found to be bleeding and hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery. Arista was applied to the area for further hemostasis.  The fascia was closed with a running suture of 0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and hemostasis noted. The skin was closed with staples.  A sterile dressing was applied to the incision.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.
