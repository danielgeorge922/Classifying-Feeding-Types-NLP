The plan overnight, per Dr. [**NAME**] and Dr. [**NAME**], was to start the epoprostenol at 1ng/kg/hr and then transfer the patient to L&D. Due to the development of Afib/RVR, we have not started the epoprostenol. As per the initial plan, and Dr. [**NAME**]'s request this morning, patient was transferred to L&D this am in case she needs an emergent c-section. She will be continued on an esmolol drip, but has not been started on the epoprostenol.
