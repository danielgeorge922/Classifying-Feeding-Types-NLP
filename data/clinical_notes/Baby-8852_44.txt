Lactation Note: Mom states that she is having difficulty latching the baby onto the left breast. Her left nipple is slightly flat some nipple tissue is everted. I taught her how to hand express and put her colostrum on her nipples before she latches the baby onto the breast. The baby did latch onto the left breast as I helped her hold her breast in a C hold and  Sandwiched the breast to latch the baby onto the breast. Mom asked about the nipple shield and I taught her how to use a 16 mm nipple shield and the baby latched onto the right the breast and had a good latch with a nutritive suck. the baby is able to latch on the right breast with or without the nipple shield. Mom felt warm to touch and [**NAME**] took her temperature and her temperature was elevated ,it was 102.3. I helped mom latch the baby onto both breast during the consult and when the baby came off the breast, the nipple appeared pinched and mom said is also hurt with the 16 mm nipple shield. I gave a 20 mm nipple shield for the right breast and she can use the 16mm for the left breast. I assessed the tongue with a gloved finger and the baby does have a posterior tight frenulum, and I made peds aware.
