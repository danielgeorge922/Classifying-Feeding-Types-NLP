Lactation Note: Mom states that she has been bottle feeding after offering the baby the breast ,because the baby is fussy at the breast and does not stay on the breast . I assessed the baby's tongue with a gloved finger and the baby was able to bring her tongue over the ridge cup her tongue around my finger. At times she would slap her tongue. The baby would not stay latched onto the breast as I assisted mom with the latch. Then I used a 20 mm nipple shield and a supplemental feeder and the baby had a good latch with a nutritive suck. The baby had about 25 mls.. Mom was instructed to pump every time she feeds the baby a bottle; I told her the risk of decreased milk supply. Mom agreed to give the baby a little bit of the bottle and put formula on the tip of the nipple shield and latch the baby onto the breast.mom has a vertical abrasion on the R nipple and a raw appearance on the L nipple; I gave her lanolin with instructions. Mom instructed to breast feed on demand, and place the baby skin to skin in between feedings.
