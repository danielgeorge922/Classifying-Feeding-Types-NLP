Ob ultrasound:   Cephalic presentation  Posterior placenta  AFI 3.8 cm  EFW 2131 g (<10%)   I discussed with the patient and her family the finding of IUGR and oligohydramnios.  At 36 weeks gestation, we would recommend delivery.  She has a history of a cesarean delivery at 34 weeks gestation for fetal bradycardia in addition to a prior SVD.  We do not have the operative report from her cesarean delivery but there is no indication that she would have had a classical incision.  We discussed TOLAC vs repeat cesarean delivery.  We discussed the risk of TOLAC including uterine rupture, hemorrhage, and need for stat cesarean delivery.  I used the help of the cyricom interpretor to discuss this.  The patient would like to discuss with her family and will decide after.    [**NAME**], MD
