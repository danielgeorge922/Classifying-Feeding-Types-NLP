Pt called for RN.  She stated she could "feel a little cramping".  She said it wasn't painful but she was aware of it.  She got on BSC & a small amount of dark blood was observed on her pad.  She changed pads & when she got up she said "I can feel it coming out of me again".  Pad had a smear of dark brownish red blood on it.  She changed pads again. When she got back into bed I asked her to lie on her back to monitor contraction activity accurately.   MgSO4 increased to 3g/hr.  Reported to Dr [**NAME**] & Dr [**NAME**].  No new orders @ this time.  Will cont to monitor closely.
