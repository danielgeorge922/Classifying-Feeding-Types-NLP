This note was copied from the chart of BOY/Pebbles Ward. Mom reports she nursed her other 3 children for approx 4 weeks then returned to work and began to exclusively formula feed.  States she will be staying home longer this time but did not verbalize length of time she plans to breastfeed this baby.  Discussed benefits of exclusive breastmilk feedings and encouraged to establish breastfeeding but mom states her nipples are hurting with latch and her left one was bleeding after the last feed.  Infant's oral anatomy assessed and frenulum noted to be tight and almost to the tip of the tongue.  Unable to achieve proper suck on gloved finger.  Discussed impact of restricted tongue mobility on breastfeeding and potential for pain, damage to nipples and insufficient milk transfer.  Pediatric team notified to please evaluate for frenotomy.  Encouraged mom to call for assistance with latches.
