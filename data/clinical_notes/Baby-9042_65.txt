Problem: Pain, Acute And Chronic Goal: Pain is relieved/acceptable level w/minimal side effects Outcome: Ongoing Pt returned from NICU and requested pain meds. She states she hurts more when she has been still for a prolonged period of time. I removed her PIV as she states her bleeding is minimal and she denies any complications and no blood clots. She states her baby is holding on and she acknowledges that baby does better when she is there. I encouraged her to have the baby nurse call for her pain meds if she becomes too uncomfortable and does not want to leave the unit to return to her room.
