Mum is breast feeding on demand and for as long as baby wants. She has an excellent supply of colostrum. Baby is cueing well and often and even though mother requested a pacifier she has not used it as yet. Baby latches well, mother needs a little help with positioning baby - nose to nipple. I instructed her on this technique and she is trying to do this. Overall Mum is very positive about breast feeding and keen to do it for a year.
