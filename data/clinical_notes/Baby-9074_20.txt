MOB reported that she started her prenatal care at around 30 wks gestation at Putnum OBGYN. MOB stated that she did not know she was pregnant until late in her pregnancy because she was not gaining weight and continued to get her period. SW informed MOB that her records showed only two visits at Putnum OBGYN and MOB confirmed this information. MOB stated that she was supposed to come to Women's Healthy at [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] (because of High Risk Pregnancy), but did not because it was too far. SW talked with MOB about the importance of early, consistent prenatal care. It should be noted that MOB's prenatal records from Putnum OBGYN included a UDS positive for methamphetamines on [**DATE**]) and the OBGYN informed MOB that she needed to get prenatal care at [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] because of her drug use. MOB reported that FOB ([**NAME**]) is involved and supportive. MOB stated that her mother is also a strong support. She stated that she, FOB, MOB's mother, and MOB's son (Malachi - age 10) all live together. SW asked MOB about her other child (age 8). MOB stated that she had the two boys so close together that she did not think she could take care of that child and gave him for adoption.  MOB reported that all of baby's needs are met, including clothes, diapers, car seat, and crib/bassinet.  MOB reported that she is enrolled in WIC, Food Stamps, and said she would accept a referral for Healthy Start.  SW talked with MOB about her history of drug abuse. SW informed MOB that the UDS taken before her delivery was positive for methamphetamines, opiates, and marijuana. SW also informed MOB that baby tested positive for methamphetamines. MOB only said "Really?!?" However, she did not deny using the drugs. SW asked MOB if she had history with any other drug use. MOB stated that she was using IV dilaudid about a year ago, but has not used any in about a year.  SW informed MOB that because of her drug use during pregnancy and her (and baby's) positive drug screen at delivery, SW would be contacting DCF. MOB responded appropriately, and did not appear surprised. SW educated MOB about SIDS, Back to Sleep, Shaken Baby Syndrome, and Post-Partum Depression.  After leaving MOB's room, SW called DCF Child Abuse Hotline ([**CONTACT_PHONE**]-ABUSE) to make a report concerning the positive UDS for methamphetamines, opiates, and marijuana and because of drug use throughout pregnancy. SW made report to DCF Operator #[**ID**] , [**NAME**], who accepted the report and indicated immediate response. SW later met with [**LOCATION_CITY**] County DCF Investigator, [**NAME**] ([**CONTACT_PHONE**]) who provided a signed DCF Medical Records Release form. SW placed form in baby's chart and provided baby's pertinent records. SW introduced Ms. [**NAME**] to MOB and Ms. [**NAME**] began her assessment.  SW later heard from Putnum County DCF Investigator, [**NAME**] ([**CONTACT_PHONE**]) who stated that she would be handling the case for Putnum County. Ms. [**NAME**] requested medical records for MOB and MOB signed a release for Ms. [**NAME**] (placed in MOB's chart), so SW faxed records to Ms. [**NAME**] in Putnum County.   SW will continue to follow.
