The anterior shoulder was easily delivered, followed by uncomplicated delivery of the posterior shoulder. The remainder of the infant's body was delivered atraumatically. The umbilical cord was clamped and cut and the infant was passed to the mother. All four extremities were moving and the infant cried spontaneously. The placenta was then delivered intact without difficulty. The vagina and perineum were examined and a third degree laceration was noted.  Either end of the capsule was grasped with two Aliss forceps. The ends of the capsule were reapproximated with a series of interrupted suture of 2-0 vicryl. The remainder of the repair was closed in the usual fashion using 3-0 vicryl.  A rectal exam was performed and confirmed that there was not a fourth degree laceration and there were no suture in the rectum. Bleeding was minimal and fundus was firm after delivery.
