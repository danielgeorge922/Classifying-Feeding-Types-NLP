Spoke with Ms. [**NAME**] about low hematocrit level this morning. She is currently experiencing dizziness and headaches. I told her that her anemia could be a cause of her symptoms. We spoke about the option of blood transfusion and the risks and benefits associated with it. She declines blood transfusion at this time secondary to family member passing away after complications following a blood transfusion. I explained to her that she may continue to be symptomatic without the blood transfusion and upon discharge we would like her to continue taking her iron tablets 3 times a day to help her maintain her blood levels. We would also like to see her in clinic within a week or two to check her symptoms and H/H. She is ok with this plan. A message was sent to our coordinator to help with planning this visit. Patient is ok to discharge today.  [**NAME**], MD
