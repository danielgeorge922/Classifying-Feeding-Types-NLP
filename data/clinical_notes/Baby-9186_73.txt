Patient over from MBU for NST. She is also complaining of suprapubic and right sided abdominal pain. She is still unable to urinate spontaneously and has been getting q6hr I&O cath. She states she doesn't know why she can't urinate, but only that it is "hard." She denies contractions, VB, fevers/chills, or abnormal vaginal discharge. She reports good FM. On exam, patient with a soft abdomen and suprapubic tenderness. No fundal tenderness. On speculum exam, fetal head seen immediately upon opening speculum. Secondary to not being able to assess cervical dilation or station, a digital exam was performed, which was 4-5/80/-1. Of note, pt was cl/th/high on admission on [**DATE**]. There was no purulent discharge and no bleeding. BPP [**DATE**], 2 off for fluid.   Will transfer patient back to L&D, obtain BMP, and start mag for NP only with 6g loading bolus followed by 1g/hr given recent urinating difficulties. Will likely place foley catheter. Will augment patient if evidence of infection/abruption, declining renal function, or for fetal heart rate tracing abnormalities. Will continue oral PPROM antibiotics, GBS negative.   Discussed with Dr. [**NAME**], MD
