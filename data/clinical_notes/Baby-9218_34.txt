I went to assess Ms. [**NAME**]'s pushing.  Cervix is C/C/+2 with minimal caput.  The patient has had poor maternal effort but has pushed for 2 hours.  After discussion on the interpretor phone (#66001) about the need for adequate pushing and possibility of cesarean delivery as the head is slightly high for a vacuum, the patient began to push adequately.  Her pelvis is adequate for delivery. Fetal tracing overall reassuring.  Will continue to push and reassess in 30 minutes.   [**NAME**], MD
