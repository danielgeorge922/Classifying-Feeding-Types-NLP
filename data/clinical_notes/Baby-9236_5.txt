Bicornuate uterus with rudimentary right horn and pregnancy located in primary left horn, normal left tube and ovary.  Right tube and ovary obscured by adhesions.  Liveborn infant male weighing 3864 grams with Apgars of 8 and 9.  Bladder intact without spill of sterile milk after backfill at end of case.  Indication: [**NAME**] is a 37 y.o. female para 3104 at 37 weeks gestation who presented for scheduled repeat cesearean delivery and BTI.  Her pregnancy had been complicated by a history of 3 prior cesarean deliveries with high suspicion of severe adhesive disease, hypothyroidism, gestational diabetes, and a bicornuate uterus.  She was admitted to L&D and set up for surgery.  Procedure: After satisfactory anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped in a routine fashion for abdominal surgery.  Time-out confirmed patient and procedure.  The abdomen was entered via a low midline vertical incision and dissected down to the level of the fascia with sharp dissection and cautery. The fascia was scored in the midline, grasped on either side with Allis clamps, and extended both superiorly and inferiorly with sharp dissection. The rectus muscles were separated just to the left of the midline until a small area of peritoneum was identified.  The peritoneum was entered with sharp dissection and lifted off of the underlying peritoneum.  Through the peritoneal defect, dense adhesions could be felt between the anterior uterine wall and the overlying omentum, anterior fascial sheath, and bladder.  The peritoneum was tented up off of the uterlying uterus with a hemostat and taken down layer-by-layer both superiorly and inferiorly with Metzenbaum scissors.  When more dense areas of omental adhesion were encountered, they were undermined, doubly clamped with Kellys, the intervening segment incised, and the remaining ends ligated with a combination of Haney stitches and free ties of 2-0 vicryl.  Great care was taken to ensure hemostasis of the remaining omentum both before and after the clamps were removed.  Adhesiolysis continued over the next ~60 minutes as attempts were made to clear an area of the anterior uterus large enough to perform the hysterotomy.  As adhesions were dissected near the lower uterine segment, the bladder was back-filled with 200cc of sterile saline so that the borders of the bladder could be identified and avoided.  The bladder was adhered low on the uterine segment, therefore this area was avoided at the time of hysterotomy.  Instead, a transverse incision was made slightly above the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and extended laterally with blunt dissection.  No uterine window was identified at the time of hysterotomy.  Amniotic fluid was clear at the time of rupture.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation and gave a spontaneous cry.  The cord was clamped and cut and the baby handed to the pediatrician.  A cord segment and blood for gases and DNA was obtained.   The placenta was delivered with cord traction.  During placental delivery, the uterus was inadvertently inverted then immediately replaced in the appropriate orientation.  The uterus was grasped with a moist lap, exteriorized, and wiped out with a lap.  Ringed forceps were placed on each corner of the hysterotomy.  The uterus was then closed in a double layer closure using two sutures of 0-vicryl. The initial layer was a running locked layer and the second layer was an imbricating layer.  Excellent hemostasis was achieved with a combination of cautery and figure-of-eight sutures as needed.  The uterine tone was noted to be slightly boggy, therefore 40 extra units of pitocin were added to the IVF by anesthesia, methergine was given IM, and 1000mg of cytotec were placed in the rectum after hysterotomy closure.  Uterine tone was noted to be significantly improved.  Attention was then turned to the tubal interruption. The left tube and ovary were easily identified and found to be normal.  A portion of the left tube was grasped with Babcocks and identified by its fimbriated end.  The mid-isthmic portion was pulled up into a loop and ligated with a tie of 0-plain gut suture. A small defect was made in the mesosalpinx underneath the loop and two segments of 0-chromic passed through on a hemostat.  Both sides of the loop were ligated and the intervening segment incised.  The lumen on either side was made hemostatic with cautery.  The right tube was much more difficult to identify as it originated from the rudimetary right horn of the bicornuate uterus.  The round ligament was identified and moved out of the way.  The other nearby tubular structure was grasped with a Babcock, and noted not to contain any vacular or urologic elements.  However, it was impossible to identify this structure as fallopian tube due to absence of visible fimbriae.  The decision was made to place a Filshie clip across a clear portion of this structure near the cornua of the rudimentary right horn. A single clip was loaded in the applicated and placed at a right angle across the tube.  The clip was then closed and the applicator removed.   The uterus was placed back into the peritoneal cavity. Copious irrigation was performed at the abdominal sidewalls and over the hysterotomy site.  The uterine incision was hemostatic and uterine tone adequate. The fascia, muscle, peritoneum, and areas of omental dissection were inspected extensively and were found to be intact and hemostatic.  The bladder was back-filled with 100cc of sterile milk and the pelvis was inspected for any leakage from bladder injury.  None was noted.  Urine in the foley was clear per anesthesia.  The fascia was closed with 2 sutures of 0-PDS starting at the angles and running in a continuous fashion to meet at the midline. The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and then closed with a running stitch of 0-chromic.  The skin was closed with 4-0 monocryl.  Dermabond and a pressure dressing were applied.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.  No complications were encountered during the case.
