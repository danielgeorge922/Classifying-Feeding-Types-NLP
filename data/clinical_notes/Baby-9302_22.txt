Mother is breast feeding well, often and on demand. Baby is only staying on the breast for short periods but seems content with each feeding. Mother has ample supply colostrum. I instructed mother regarding positioning, deep latch, hand expression and milk transfer/swallowing. I will continue to assist mother today.
