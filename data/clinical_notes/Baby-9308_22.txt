Assisted PT with feeding newborn hand expressed approximately 1 mL of colostrum. PT complaining of very sore nipples and breast from all the "pumping". Newborn very fussy wanting to nurse. PT requesting formula at this time. States newborn needs to eat and she can not nurse or pump at this time due to nipple soreness. Advised PT to hand express colostrum and rub on nipples and allow to air dry to promote healing. Will continue to monitor and assist with next feeding.
