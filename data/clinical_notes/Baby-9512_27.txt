Neurology Updated recs: Pt seen by Attending Neurologist Dr. [**NAME**]. Pt states that her last generalized tonic clonic seizure was about 10-12 weeks ago. She has had myoclonic jerks however, most recent one in the past 24 hours.  Pt's keppra level can go down during pregnancy. For this reason we would recommend increasing keppra to 2000mg BID. We would recommend checking keppra levels and zonegran levels monthly through out pregnancy as this can vary with pregnancy. These will take a few days to result. We would also recommend that the pt be continued on 4mg of folic acid thorough out her pregnancy.  Would also avoid benzo for treatment myoclonic jerks. Can use benzo for treatment of generalized tonic clonic seizures.   These recommendations were relayed to the ob/gyn team.   Will leave updated recs after AED levels are back.
