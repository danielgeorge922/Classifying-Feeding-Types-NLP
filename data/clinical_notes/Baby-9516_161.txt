Lactation note: I met this pt this morning to offer her assistance with breast pumping. She verbalized a strong desire to give her baby breast milk while he is in the NICU because she "knows he needs it". She also states she does not intend to continue breast feeding when he is a little older. She states she has only pumped randomly about six times since his birth. I assured her that my job is to support her decision and assist her in developing her milk supply. I instructed her on breast massage and hand expression and provided her a handout for education reinforcement. After performing breast massage she had a drop of visible colostrum in her right breast. I educated her on proper cleaning of her pump supplies and encouraged her to take all her supplies with her at D/C to continue using in the NICU pumping room. The breast pump was attached to her breasts and placed on the premie setting. The pt is using a 27 mm flange on both breasts and denies any discomfort with their use. Her nipples are slightly flat but evert with the breast pump suction. I instructed her to use the premie setting for the full 15 minutes and to pump consistently every 2-2.5 hours during the day and at least once during the night and early morning when her prolactin level is high. The pt has some eyesight compromise and verbalizes that it is difficult for her to see. After placing her bed down on the lowest level I encouraged her to call for assistance whenever she needs it. She plans to visit the NICU after she finishes pumping. I noted the numer for the WIC office on her pumping packet and instructed her to call them to notify them of her baby's birth and her plan to breast feed. She is hoping to stay at the [**NAME**] House after her DC.
