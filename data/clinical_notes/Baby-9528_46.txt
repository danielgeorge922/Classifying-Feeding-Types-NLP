Pt received to my care at 0730. Stephane is resting in bed with infant in crib at bedside. He is using a pacifier. She has been breast feeding baby but has now changed her mind about this and is requesting formula. I talked with her regarding her reasons - she stated that it's too much for her and that her nipples hurt. I assessed her nipples which are a bit red and encouraged her to allow me to help her with latching baby. She declined and asked for formula again stating that she would pump and give baby breast milk later. Formula x4 provided with nipples. I instructed her in formula feeding, baby postioning, burping baby. The grandmother is at bedside and helping Stephane.
