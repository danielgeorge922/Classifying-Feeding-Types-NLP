Lactation Note: Mom states she has not breast fed the baby since 5 am. I taught mom how to hand express , and I hand expressed 5 mls of colostrum to a spoon and gave it to the baby. We put the baby skin to skin and I encouraged both parents to do skin to skin and feeding cues taught. The baby began to show feeding cues and I helped with latching the baby onto the breast in a football hold and the baby had a good latch with a nutritive suck. Mom instructed to breast feed as soon as she observes the feeding cues.
