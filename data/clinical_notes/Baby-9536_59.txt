Chief Note  To bedside to reassess presentation.  Foley bulb out and cervix [**DATE**] per Dr. [**NAME**], however presenting part not palpable on exam.  Ultrasound placed to abdomen reveals double footling breech presentation.   Discussed plan of care with Dr. [**NAME**].  As we are going back to the operating room for another patient's cesarean delivery, we will stop all induction procedures and continue to monitor the patient at this time.  Her blood pressures are currently well controlled.  If she continues to contract as if she is in labor, then we will need to proceed with cesarean delivery tonight.  If not, her cesarean may be delayed until the morning.  We will re-assess in 1-2 hours.  [**NAME**] MD MA
