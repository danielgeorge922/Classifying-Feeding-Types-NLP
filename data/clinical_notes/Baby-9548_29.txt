Chief Note  To bedside with Dr. [**NAME**] and Dr. [**NAME**].  Briefly, she is a 26 y.o. P0 at 38w2d now almost 48 hours into induction of labor for gestational hypertension.  Her foley bulb came out in the early morning of [**DATE**].  Her cervix has remained at essentially [**DATE**] since, although her cervix was initially difficult to examine.  We discussed with the patient that her pitocin has been at 26 all day and that her cervix has not made any change.  In order to proceed with induction, we will need to rupture her membranes and allow her fetus to apply pressure to her cervix.  We discussed the risk of cord prolapse and non-reassuring feta tracing, including fetal death secondary to these risks, and the need for emergent cesarean delivery should this occur.  Consents: Cesarean delivery Specific counseling: The patient was counseled on risks, benefits, indications and alternatives to cesarean delivery, including bleeding, infection, damage to adjacent organs or the fetus, and reaction to anesthesia. Patient understands the risks, accepts the risks including but not limited to those above, and consents to the procedure.  Consents signed and on chart.  Blood Transfusion Specific Counseling: The patient was counseled on risks, benefits, indications and alternatives to blood transfusion, including infection (HIV, hepatitis, CMV, unknown), transfusion reaction, allergic reaction, metabolic complications, cardiac arrhythmia, and death. Patient understands the risks, accepts the risks including but not limited to those above, and consents to blood transfusion should it become necessary.  Consents signed and on chart.  The patient was then placed in dorsal lithotomy position and Dr. [**NAME**] attempted to examine her cervix.  Fundal pressure was applied and her legs were held in McRoberts position, however she was unable to obtain clear access to the membranes for safe rupture.   At this time I took over.  SVE [**DATE**].  Amniotomy performed with slow release of clear fluid.  Multiple rechecks were made to assure there was no cord prolapse.  At the end of the controlled release, the fetal head was much more well-applied to the cervix.  A: Successful amniotomy at 2100.   P: Continue pitocin IOL, increase per protocol.
