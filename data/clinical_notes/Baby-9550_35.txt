Lactation assistance: The pt welcomed me warmly upon my introduction and offering for assistance. She verbalized immediately some concerns with baby's latch and nipple trauma to her right breast. She stated that baby had nursed for 45 minutes earlier and she felt the pain but did not know what to do so she kept nursing. She denies any pain on the left breast but said she was unable to latch baby on that side anyway. She has pendulous supple breasts with slightly everted nipples that respond to well to tactile stimulation. I first instructed her on STS with its many benefits and breast massage and hand expression during which I undressed baby and placed her STS. Colostrum was readily expressed and baby was placed in a football hold and was easily asymmetrically latched to the breast. I explained the details of a deep latch with the chin tucked into the breast, good support to the neck and shoulders and a clear airway to the nose. The patient practiced breast massage, hand expression and a supportive hand hold in a safe manner for her and baby. I provided her with written materials for her education reinforcement. The baby was noted to chomp and some nipple compression was noted on the left nipple when baby was detached. I informed the Peds service and requested an assessment with the baby exam. Nipple cream was provided for the pt's comfort and instructions on its use.
