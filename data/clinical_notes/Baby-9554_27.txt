Lactation assistance: The pt verbalized great satisfaction at my arrival and verbalized concerns about the baby's latch. I educated her on how to support the baby's shoulders while latching baby close to her breast so chin touches and head tilts back to facilitate an assymetric latch. Baby nursed on mothers left breast for several minutes without the use of a nipple shield. Breast massage and hand expression were taught and the pt demonstrated both techniques appropriately. The breastfeeding booklet and invitation to the breast feeding support group were provided. The pt called me back about an hour later as she was having difficulty latching baby on the right breast. The baby was calmed down with a gloved finger and then placed STS in a football hold. After several attempts the baby was not able to latch on effectively and appeared more and more upset. The pt used a 20 mm nipple shield and the baby latched for just a few moments but was still having difficulty. A 24 mm nipple shield was then used and baby latched much better and was suckling better at the breast without difficulty. I encouraged both the pt and the FOB to call back at any time breastfeeding support is needed or questions arise.
