Lactation assistance and support: I assisted this pt with positioning and deep latch techniques after she communicated that baby is on her breast for an extended amount of time but wanting to continue nursing frequently. I educated her on the need to perform breast massage and hand expression prior to breast feeding. She was able to perform a return demonstration appropriately. STS benefits to mom and baby were discussed and reccommended as much as possible. Baby was positioned in the football hold and latch asymmetrically with notable nutritive sucking. The details of a deep latch were noted including a flanged mouth, chin embedded in the breast and small areola skin visible on top of the breast. The pt denies any pain with this breastfeeding event. Upon examination her breasts had no signs of redness or cracking. I provided her with the [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] Breastfeeding booklet and highlighted the contact numbers for community resources and lactation F/U after D/C. I also informed her about the mothers breastfeeding support group and provided her with an invitation. I left her with instructions to call for any questions or concerns with breastfeeding.
