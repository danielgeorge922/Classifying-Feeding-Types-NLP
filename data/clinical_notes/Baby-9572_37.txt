Failed induction Postoperative Diagnosis: Same  Operation Performed: Low transverse cesarean   Surgeon: [**NAME**]  Assistants: [**NAME**] (MS-[**ID**]), Jewett (MS-1)  Anesthesiologist: Euliano  Anesthesia: Epidural   Procedure:   Prior to the start of surgery, a time-out was taken, and the patient's identity and operative procedure were verified.  The peritoneal cavity then was entered without complication through a  Pfannenstiel incision.  The lower uterine segment was identified, and the bladder flap was created by sharp and blunt dissection.  A horizontal incision was made in the lower uterine segment, and the first infant was delivered from a cephalic presentation without difficulty.  The baby was a  2290 gram  male and had Apgar scores of 9 and 7 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The second infant was also delivered from a cephalic position. This baby was a female who weighed 1957 grams. Her Apgar scores were 9 and 9. The placenta was removed by gentle traction on the umbilical cord.  It was intact, and the cord had 3 vessels.  The myometrium then was closed in two layers using continuous sutures of 0-Vicryl.  The pericolic gutters were carefully irrigated.  The fascial edges then were re-approximated with two continuous sutures of 0-Vicryl.  The wound was  irrigated, and the lower half of the subcutaneous tissue was re-approximated with a running suture of 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin edges were re-approximated with an intracuticular suture of 3-0 Monocryl.  The estimated blood loss during surgery was 800 ml, and the patient received 1500 ml of Plasmalyte solution. Urine output during surgery was 100 mL.  At the conclusion of the procedure, the sponge count and needle count were correct.  The neonate was transported to the newborn nursery in good condition, and the mother was transported to the recovery room, also in good condition.  The patient received an injection of cefazolin plus azithromycin to reduce the risk of postoperative infection.  [**NAME**], M.D. Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology
