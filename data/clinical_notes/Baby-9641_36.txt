Lactation support and assistance: The pt was pumping with the dual hospital grade breast pump when I visited her this morning. She verbalized having intense pain when baby latches so is unable to put baby on her breasts. She is currently pumping and bottle feeding baby her EBM which is abundant in supply. I returned later to find baby in the crib and the pt waiting to pump again at 1000. We talked about breast massage and the benefits for stimulation and engorgement prevention. She was able to demonstrate the appropriate techniques for both hand expression and breast massage. The baby was demonstrating advance feeding cues so the pt agreed to my assistance with latching baby with a 24 mm nipple shield. Baby was successfully latched deeply and asymmetrically to the right breast which was very full and firm. Colostrum was easily expressed and applied to the nipple shield in advance of the latch. Dr [**NAME**] and the peds team confirmed on exam that baby has a posterior tight frenulum and the pt agreed to a frenotomy to be performed when the circumcision is done. I instructed the pt to call me when the procedures are complete for assistance with positioning and latching baby again. We discussed the risks of using a pacifier and the benefits of STS and demand feedings.   [**NAME**] RN RN, [**NAME**], BSN
