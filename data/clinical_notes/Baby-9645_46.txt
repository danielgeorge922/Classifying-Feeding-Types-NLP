Lactation support and assistance: I assisted this pt with positioning and latching her baby for a 1000 feeding. She was tearful when I arrived and expressed concern about her milk supply. I instructed her on breast massage and hand expression which she demonstrated back to me appropriately. The baby was then positioned in a football hold on her left side and successfully latched asymmetrically to her breast and demonstrated a consistent and rhythmic suck swallow sequence for about 10-15 minutes. The pt denied any pain or tenderness while baby was nursing. I commended her on her breastfeeding technique and good support to her infants neck and shoulders. She verbalized concern about her medications for anxiety and stated that she will bottle feed if she decides to go back on her medications. We discussed weaning methods to prevent engorgement should that become necessary. I reviewed her breastfeeding booklet with her and encouraged lactation F/U when she gets home. No further needs or questions were presented at this time. [**NAME**] RN, CLC, BSN
