I explained to the patient that there have been several emergent cases today and that this is why her case has been delayed. She was very understanding. Her FHT showed a possible late decel around 1330, so she will be unable to go home. I d/w Dr. [**NAME**] and she can have clears up to 2 hours priro to her CS. Will give a popsicle now.
