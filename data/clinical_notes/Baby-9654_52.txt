This note was copied from the chart of GIRL/[**NAME**]. Lactation:  F/u consult at the telephoned request of the FOB.  Mother and baby were assisted this morning by lactation nurse [**NAME**] who noted "very sore reddened nipples," and baby subsequently underwent a frenotomy by Dr. [**NAME**].    [**NAME**] is a 22 y/o primipara who gave birth to her infant female via SVD on [**CONTACT_PHONE**] at 5:52pm.  GA by dates: 40w 1d.  GA by exam: 40 weeks AGA.  Birth weight:  3380g (7lb 7.2oz).  APGARS [**DATE**].  Pitocin was used as a pre/perinatal medication.  Baby was resuscitated by suctioning, oxygen, and PPV.    Maternal history:  Depression managed with Zoloft and Buspar.    Maternal breast assessment:  Breasts are medium in size, closely spaced, and somewhat pendulous.  The right breast is softer than the L, and mother reports baby just finished nursing on the rt.  The L breast was heavy prior to the feed, becoming softer as the feeding progressed, and we discussed the mother's early onset of her second milk coming in re: Lactogenesis II [L2] at less than 24 hours postpartum.  The nipple anatomy is quite short on the right, and the left nipple is flat though protractile to a short length via gentle tactile nipple stimulation.  There are pronounced abrasions to both nipples, more significant on the L.  Infant assessment for feeding readiness:  Babe was nursing at the right breast upon my arrival, and displayed hand-to-mouth behavior and licking of lips prior to subsequently nursing on the L breast.    Feeding assessment: Due to the extent of the mother's nipple damage as well as the flat nipple on the L, a 24mm nipple shield was used during the entire feed in cross cradle hold and cradle hold on the L.  Mother rated her pain level as "7" on a 0 to 10 pain scale after the initial latch at the one-minute mark, and after the baby had been nursing well over ten minutes.    Patient teaching:  Mother was advised that short and/or flat nipple anatomy is a risk factor for nipple damage, though not all mothers with short and/or flat nipple anatomy experience nipple soreness and/or nipple trauma.  However, the mother was advised that the shorter nipple can come into greater contact with the baby's gumline (upper alveolar ridge) and/or hard palate for all or part of a feeding, and that a deep latch is important for protecting the mother's nipple integrity, even with a nipple shield.      A USP-modified lanolin product with teaching was provided by mother's RN at my request, and I also asked the RN to provide the mother with breast shells for keeping her nipples protected from friction while the nipple wounds heal.  The breast shells also provide ample space so that all of the lanolin product can stay on the nipples, rather than much of the product being absorbed by bra fabric.  Mother was advised that if her nipple wounds become more painful that what she can tolerate, she may express her milk for any missed feedings in order to support her milk production while her nipple wounds continue to heal.  Mother was encouraged to call for assistance as desired, and to call with any questions or concerns.      [**NAME**], RN BSN IBCLC Lactation Consultant
