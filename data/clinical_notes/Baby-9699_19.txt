Went to assess Ms. [**NAME**]'s progress in the second stage.  She is pushing well and the fetal station has changed to C/C/+2.  Fetal tracing 160s, min to modBTBV, + variable decelerations with pushing, overall cat II tracing with good progress in labor.  Will continue to push and monitor.    [**NAME**], MD
