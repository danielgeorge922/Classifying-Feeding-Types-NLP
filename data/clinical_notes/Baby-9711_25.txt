Pt resting in bed with infant at her side. She is c/o 4/10 surgical pain and I medicated her with Percocet 10 mg. Pt has been breast feeding and formula feeding baby and the last feeding was 50 ml formula. Mother's breasts are becoming engorged already. She has been pumping and doing hand expression. I reinforced the need to breast feed baby and reduce the amount of formula being used, and to continue pumping to soften the nipples for latching. Mother has also been using a small nipple shield on the right nipple, however, it is too small for her nipple. I provided a 24 mm shield for her. Mother will call me when baby is awake and cueing to eat.
