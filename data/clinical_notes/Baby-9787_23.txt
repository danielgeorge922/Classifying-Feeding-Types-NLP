Lactation support: I saw Mrs [**NAME**] while her baby was held by family members and she was sitting up eating her lunch. She denies any difficulty with breastfeeding and has no c/o nipple pain or soreness. I reviewed the resource information in the [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] breastfeeding booklet including lactation contact numbers for F/U after D/C. I encouraged STS and feeding baby on demand according to baby's feeding cues. I encouraged her to call for assistance whenever needed.
