Will send placenta to pathology for further evaluation.   Complications:  Upon arrival to room, Neonate had delivered with RN assistance and was vigorously crying. Umbilical cord was clamped and neonate was taken to warmer for RN assessment. Cord gases and cord were collected.  At this time IV pitocin was started and gentle traction was place on cord. Placenta was not separating, so 1st degree right labial laceration was repaired with three stitches of 3-0 vicryl. Left labia was noted to have a large (~5 cm by 5 cm) Bartholin's Cyst which per pt report has been stable for years and has never been infected. No erythema or area of fluctuance noted within cyst.    Excess membranes were noted at the perineum. Gentle traction was continued on cord in addition to fundal massage, but placenta was slow to separate.  Placenta slowly delivered and was noted to be intact. At this time a large gush of blood followed delivery of placenta. I attempted to perform uterine massage but was unable to palpate fundus. I performed bimanual uterine massage and immediately noted a complete uterine inversion.   Pitocin was stopped. Dr. [**NAME**] and anesthesia were called to bedside STAT.  I attempted to apply direct pressure directly upward with my fist in attempt to revert the uterus. Sublingual Nitroglycerin was called for and two doses of subinginal nitro was given by Dr. [**NAME**]. Uterus still would not revert. 0.25 mg IM Terbutaline was given. Dr. [**NAME**] with successful version of uterus. Uterine tone noted to improve shortly after. I performed direct bimanual massage. Uterine tone noted to be firm. 1000 mcg of Misoprostol placed rectally. Total EBL for delivery and post partum hemorrhage from uterine inversion was ~1000cc. Fundus was firm and bleeding was scant. Perineum was reexamined for any additional lacerations. No lacerations were noted.   STAT CBC and Coags were sent following completion of delivery. Antibiotics will be given secondary to extensive manipulation of uterus,   9:03 AM [**NAME**], MD
