Liveborn infant male weighing 822 grams with Apgars of 2 and 2 and 7.  Indication: [**NAME**] is a 46 y.o. female para 0100 who presented with cervical funneling seen on ultrasound at 24w6d.  She progressed to 4/c/-2 and fetus was found to be in frank breech presentation.    Procedure: After satisfactory anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped in a routine fashion for abdominal surgery. Time-out confirmed patient and procedure. The abdomen was entered with a Pfannensteil approach. Skin incision was made with scapel; this was carried down to the underlying layer of fascia and this was scored in the midline. The rectus muscles were separated in the midline and the peritoneum was entered with sharp dissection while maintaining visualization of the bowel and bladder. The superior aspect of the fascial incision was grasped upward and the underlying rectus muscle was dissected away with a combination of sharp and blunt dissection.  Attention was then turned to the inferior aspect which was grasped upward and underlying rectus muscles were dissected away with sharp dissection. A low classical incision was made in the muscular portion of the uterus with a scalpel and extended with bandage scissors.   Amniotic fluid was clear. The above described infant was delivered from the breech presentation. The cord was clamped and the cord was cut and the baby handed to the pediatrician who was present for delivery. Blood for gases and DNA was obtained. The placenta was manually extracted.   The uterus was cleared of clots and debris. The uterus was exteriorized. The uterus was closed with a four layer closure.  Initial layer was a 0-monocryl locking layer; the second and third layers were an imbricating layer of 0-monocryl.  The fourth layer was a 2-0 vicryl baseball stitch to reapproximate the serosa.  The uterus was replaced into the patient's abdomen. The hysterotomy was hemostatic as was the fascia and rectus muscles.   The fascia was closed with 0-Vicryl starting at the angle and running in a continuous fashion. The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated with normal saline and was found to be hemostatic. The skin was closed with with 0-monocryl. Dermabond was applied. The vagina was cleared of clots. All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.   [**NAME**]
