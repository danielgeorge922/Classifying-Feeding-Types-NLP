Date of Surgery: [**DATE**]  PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  1) Intrauterine pregnancy at 39 weeks 2) Prior cesarean delivery x 1 3) Undesired fertility  POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  1) Intrauterine pregnancy at 39 weeks 2) Prior cesarean delivery x 1 3) Undesired fertility  PROCEDURE:  1) Low transverse cesarean section 2) Modified Pomeroy postpartum bilateral tubal interruption  SURGEON: Kreinest  ASSISTANT: [**NAME**]  ANESTHESIOLOGIST: [**NAME**] ANESTHESIA ASSISTANT: [**NAME**]  ANESTHESIA: Spinal  EBL: 600 mL  FLUID REPLACEMENT: 2500 mL  FINDINGS: Normal uterus, tubes and ovaries bilaterally.  Liveborn infant female weighing 3773 grams with Apgars of 2, 8 and 9.  SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY:  Segments from each tube  INDICATIONS: [**NAME**] is a 29 y.o. female para 1001 who had a history of a prior cesarean delivery who presented for scheduled repeat low transverse cesarean section with bilateral tubal interruption.   DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was identified and brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  A time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed.  After the establishment of adequate regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal supine position in left lateral tilt and her abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A second time-out was taken and the patient's identity and planned surgical procedure were confirmed; it was confirmed that her antibiotics were being administered and that her pneumatic compression stockings were in place and functioning.   The abdomen was entered in the routine manner through a Pfanenstiel incision.  A bladder flap was created.  A transverse incision was made in the lower uterine segment with a scalpel and the incision was extended bilaterally with traction.  The amniotic fluid was clear.  The above described infant was delivered from the Cephalic presentation.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut and the baby was handed to the awaiting pediatrician. A sample of cord and cord blood was obtained for analysis.  The placenta was delivered with gentle traction on the cord, and the uterine cavity was cleared with a clean lap.  The uterus was exteriorized, and the uterine incision was closed in two layers, the first a running suture of 0 Monocryl and the second a running, imbricating suture of 0 Monocryl.    The right fallopian tube was identified to its fimbriated end and a modified Pomeroy tubal ligation was performed. Adequate hemostasis was assured.  The exact same procedure was performed on the opposite side after identifying that tube to its fimbriated end; again, adequate hemostasis was assured.  The uterus was replaced in the abdominal cavity.  Adequate hemostasis was confirmed along the uterine incision and in the subfascial area.  The peritoneum was closed and the muscle re-approximated using 2-0 Vicryl. The fascia was closed with a two sutures of 0 Vicryl starting at each corner and meeting in the middle.  The subcutaneous tissue was closed with a running suture of 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with a running subcuticular closure of 3-0 Monocryl.  Benzoin, Steri-Strips, and a sterile dressing were applied to the incision.  The vagina was cleared of clots.  All counts were correct and the patient left for the recovery room in good condition.
