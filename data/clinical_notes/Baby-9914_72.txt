Please see previous SW notes for continuity.  SW met with MOB and requested that she sign Consent for Release stating that baby can be released to MOB's parents ([**NAME**] and [**NAME**]). MOB signed the document and SW placed in baby's chart. MOB also provided a notarized letter for SW to give to her parents stating that her father and sister can make medical decisions for baby (her mother already has one at home).   After MOB was discharged, baby's maternal grandparents ([**NAME**] and [**NAME**]) arrived on the unit for baby's discharge. Both Mr. & Mrs. [**NAME**] provided photo IDs and SW made a copy of the IDs and placed them in baby's chart. Mr. & Mrs. [**NAME**] signed the Receipt for Custody and SW signed as witness and placed in baby's chart.   Baby may be discharged home with [**NAME**] and [**NAME**] (maternal grandparents) when he is medically cleared to go home.  SW has no other plans for patient at this time.
