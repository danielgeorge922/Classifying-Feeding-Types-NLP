Went to room to evaluate patient. Complains of new headache with spots in front of her eyes. Patient states this has probably been going on for a while just just didn't realize it was a sign to report. Will try tylenol now and revaluate.  1+ reflexes LE bilaterally, no clonus  Filed Vitals:   [**DATE**] 1704 [**DATE**] 1852 [**DATE**] 1853 [**DATE**] 1923  BP: 127/66 149/79 149/79 134/58  Pulse:      Resp:      Height:      Weight:       [**NAME**] [**NAME**], MD
