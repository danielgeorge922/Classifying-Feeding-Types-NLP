Lactation support and assistance: I provided education regarding breast massage and hand expression to support mammary stimulation and milk production. The pt returned appropriate demonstrations of both techniques and colostrum was visible from the right breast.I reviewed the [**LOCATION_INSTITUTE**] breast feeding booklet with her and emphasized the resources available after d/c from the hospital. The pt c/o difficulty breastfeeding on her left breast specifically in the football hold. I suggested that she try the cross cradle hold which worked very well at this attempt. The baby latched on well and was noted to display nutritive sucking and swallowing. The baby was in good alignment and displayed contentment while nursing. I commended the pt on her efforts and technique. I assured her that the wet diapers and stools are affirmative signs of the baby getting her colostrum. The pt was extended an invitation to the breast feeding support group and contact info was provided. The FOB was present and very receptive and supportive of breastfeeding. I encouraged him to perform STS with his daughter as well which he responding to very positively. I encouraged them both to call for any questions or concerns they may have during their stay.
